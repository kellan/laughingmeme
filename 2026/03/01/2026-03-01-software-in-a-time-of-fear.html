<p>I enjoyed this essay from my friend Ed Lyons, which I think speaks well to <em>my</em> particular state of mind as someone who has been in this industry for 30+ years, a parent, a people leader, a builder.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Up front, here are the lessons:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Stop listening to people who are afraid</li>
    <li>Seek first-hand testimony, not opinions</li>
    <li>Go with someone much more enthusiastic than you</li>
    <li>Do not look down</li>
    <li>You must get different equipment</li>
    <li>Put the summit out of your mind</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Yet I hope you stay for the hike up.</p>

<p>Personally I’m working on 1, 2, 3, and 5. I’m struggling with 4 and 6.</p>
