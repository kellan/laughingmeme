    <p>The hardest part about recommending Bujold to folks (<a href="http://laughingmeme.org/2007/06/29/bujold-booksmith/">beyond my tendency to over sell</a>) is figuring out where to tell folks to start. Clearly with the Vorkosigan universe, but where? And whence? This occupied us much on the way home Saturday night, without resolution. And came up again this evening, so I thought I’d externalize the debate.</p>

<p><em>Shard’s of Honor/Cordelia’s Honor</em> is a good place to start. It really is the beginning of the Miles story arc. It features Cordelia, one of my all time favorite literary characters, and <em>Barrayar</em> (aka the 2nd half of <em>Cordelia’s Honor</em>) floats well above its pulpy genre roots, and truly, distinctively sings.</p>

<p>Of course <em>Warrior’s Apprentice</em> is the easiest entry point, the first book in the series published (presumably because of its obvious and wider appeal), and is the first Miles book. In addition it was written after the first half of Cordelia’s Honor, but before the 2nd half, and it shows. (at least if you’ve read and read and read the text)</p>

<p>Some people would say start with <em>Floating Free</em>, which after all is the first choronologically in the universe. And frankly it loses something when set in a familiar universe, rather then a strange one. (after all if you already <em>know</em> what quaddies are, why spend 100 pages describing them?)</p>

<p>I tend to want to settle the issue by telling people</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“the <strong>first</strong> time through the series, start with <em>Warrior’s Apprentice</em>, and the <strong>second</strong> time through start with <em>Shard’s of Honor</em>“.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At which point people’s eye glaze over. So I risk it, and hand them Cord’s Honor, and hope for the best.</p>

<p>And the problems continue!</p>

<p>After all, do you skip <em>The Vor Game</em>, which is the weakest book in the series, but also contians much of the key foundation for the rest of the Miles books. How about <em>Cetaganda</em> which chronologically comes after <em>The Vor Game</em>, but is written much later? (okay, that is an easy one, clearly <em>Borders of Infinity</em> should be read after <em>Vor Game</em>, followed either by <em>Brothers in Arms</em> (soso) on the first reading, or <em>Cetaganda</em> and <em>Ethan of Athos</em> on the 2nd reading.)</p>

<p>And do you power though the inevitable mid-series lag to get to the power houses of <em>Mirror Dance</em>, and <em>Memory</em>, shading into her master works, <em>Komarr</em>, and <em>Civil Campaign</em>. (consider not reading Civil Campaign until you’ve read most of the series more then once, or you’ll miss half of it)</p>

<p>(Of course I’ve been informed that some folks <strong>hate</strong> <em>Memory</em>, and loved <em>Diplomatic Immunity</em> which I’d tell you to pass on, and under no condition read without first reading Cetaganda.)</p>

<p>And where does <em>Dreamweaver’s Dilemma</em> fit in? (um, after you’ve read the series 5 times or so).</p>

<p>Useful to also be caught up on your Georgette Heyer, Dorothy Sayers, Jane Austin, Patrick O’Brian, William Shakespeare, Robert Heinlein, and Judith Butler. (not that you have to like all of them)</p>

<p>Anyone else ever sweated this one?</p>
