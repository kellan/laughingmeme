<p>I’m 25 as of yesterday. I can’t say it seems much different. Perhaps the strangest expirence of all was talking with the <a href="http://www.fivecolleges.edu">Five Colleges, Inc</a> today, and realizing that I’ve been working with these people, and writing calendar software for them since I was 20.</p>
