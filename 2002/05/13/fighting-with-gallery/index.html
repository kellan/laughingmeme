    <h3 id="install-php-cgi-or-turning-mole-hills-into-mountains">Install PHP CGI, or Turning Mole Hills into Mountains</h3>

<p>I’ve always used PHP compiled into Apache, so PHP CGI was new to me. And for the life of me, I couldn’t figure out how the hell to begin. I searched the documentation, typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./configure --help</code> dozens of time, finally opening up the configure script and going through it line by line. I simply could not find a parameter, argument, option, environement variable, or config file, that said, “Build PHP as a CGI”. Which brings us to the problem of, “How does one document a negative?” PHP apparently expects to be compiled as a CGI. The fact that no one does this, hasn’t changed that basic assumption. So just compile the damn thing sans <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--with-apache</code>, and you’ve got a PHP CGI executable ready to go. Hmmm, we’re already 30 minutes over budget for installing Gallery, and we haven’t touched it.</p>

<h3 id="compiling-or-mop-the-augean-stables">Compiling, or Mop the Augean Stables</h3>

<p>Well we’ve got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure</code> in the bag, and the freshly downloaded 4.2.0 is happily compiling, but wait! Now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> is having problems. Something about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EX_OK</code> being used before its defined. Screw it! We’ll switch back to 4.1.1 which is kicking around the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> directory, and try to build that instead. Ok that worked. Putter around trying to figure out how to enable PHP-CGI.</p>

<ul>
  <li>#!/usr/local/bin/php? No that doesn’t work.</li>
  <li>AddHandler cgi-script .php? Hmmm, nothing.</li>
  <li>AddHandler application/cgi-php, Action applicaton/cgi-php /usr/local/bin/php? 404, /usr/local/bin/php/~kellan/test.php not found.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually settled on &gt; AddHandler application/cgi-php Action applicaton/cgi-php /cgi-bin/php.cgi</p>

<p>If that was somewhere in the PHP docs (or in the Programming PHP book which I grabbed from <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com">Safari</a>, I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re getting somewhere! Way, way, way past our 20 minutes of alloted time, but at this point, its Gallery or me.</p>

<p>And Gallery is still winning. A 505, and a quick check to error<em>log, and for some reason PHP is segfaulting. I don’t why, something about the alignment of the moons. I futz with it, and decided that maybe I need to go back and check out 4.2.0.</em></p>

<p>Morefutzing, some cursing, a thrown pillow or two, and we’ve got the lastest version of libc6-dev, and the sysexits.h contained therein, and one brand spanking new php.cgi, version 4.2.0.</p>

<h3 id="debugging-gallerys-config-wizard-or-the-evil-that-is-php">Debugging Gallery’s config wizard, or The Evil that is PHP.</h3>

<p>All of Gallery’s wonderful configuration wizards are great…until they break. Kind of like Windows, but at least I had the source. So lets look behind the curtain…. The <a href="http://www.laughingmeme.org/archives/000023.html#000023">first time I saw it</a>, I was blown away by Gallery’s wizard. This time I realized that PHP never stops being PHP, maybe it seems elegant, simple and intuitive, but under the covers its still an ugly hack.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Gallery was checking my .htaccess file by trying to fiddle a php.ini value, to prepend a file containing a global variable. Ingenous! I didn’t think you could test the .htaccess stuff without deep hooks into Apache’s core. I went looking for some mechanism for querying Apache, or parsing config files, or something. It took me forever until I realized that that peculiar little ` autoprepend<em>file    php</em>value<em>ok.php</em>` was performing the magic.</p>

    <p>But what if you’re running in CGI mode, and phpvalue isn’t supported? (if you’re me, you comment out that check, and move on)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gallery was checking to see if mod<em>rewrite was working, very logically, by rewriting a url, and seeing if it worked. In and of itself, not a bad idea. (now that we had determined it didn’t have a magic way to ask Apache about this stuff)</em></p>

    <p>But when Gallery started turning up false negatives, claiming my modrewrite didn’t work I was stumped. Much, much, too much later, and after much pain, and gnashing of teeth, I realised that Gallery was testing for the existence of a variable “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init&lt;em&gt;mod&lt;/em&gt;rewrite</code>” that was never set, and therefore must be expecting PHP to magic it into existence. (and here we note the difference between C which refused to compile without knowing what EX<em>OK was, and PHP who sailed along blindly without a care in the world)</em></p>

    <p>Well it is a reasonable assumption in PHP for variables to magically appear, and a trip to php.ini, to turn on registerglobals; an option that magicks into existence variables containing anything passed in the query string.(say if you’re script uses mod<em>rewrite to tack init</em>mod<em>rewrite=1 on to the end of your url)</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Gallery’s FAQ does actually have the question, <em>“The setup page tells me that mod</em>rewrite is not installed. Since mod<em>rewrite is optional, how do I configure this option?”</em> But the answer is less then helpful.</li>
  <li>A Google search show that the term <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">registerglobals</code> is only used once on the Gallery website, in the notes for the pre-release version of Gallery 1.3</li>
