    <p>Finally re-discovered the joys of productivity these last few days. Thursday morning I woke up realizing that I had read a lot of neat websites, posted a couple of good entries to my blogs, futz with the <a href="http://notes.techfed.net">TechFed wiki</a>, answers lots of IMC support emails, and chatted with lots of neat people on IRC, but I had nothing to show for the week. Nor last week neither.</p>

<p>But many lines of code, odds bugs, struggling with <a href="http://pair.com">Pair’s idiosyncrasies</a> and long phone calls, I’ve <strong>finally</strong> wrapped up my paying contract. Its been dragging on for months; first they were flaky, then I was back East, then they were traveling, then I was at <a href="http://ruckus.org">Ruckus</a>, etc…</p>

<p>Some things I’m (re-)learning about myself, and self-employment are.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t work well on the road.<br />
  I can keep my basic communication obligations from the odd coffeeshop, borrowed net connection, and occasional Kinkos. Especially the awful boring code hat pays my few bills.</li>
  <li>Coding requires more caffeine.<br />
  A cup or two staves off the headaches, but its takes more then that to reach the anti-meditative state where I can I really crank. At Palm I never had to face up to this reality, the coffee pot was never empty, and no one said, “Wow! I’ve never see someone go through a coffee card in a single day”</li>
</ul>

<p>But now its done. And I can get back to fun projects, and figuring out if I have time to go to Seattle and help organize for the <a href="http://www.reclaimthemedia.org">September NAB meeting</a> before heading back to NYC for Jasmine’ birthday.</p>
