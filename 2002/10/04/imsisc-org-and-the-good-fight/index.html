<meta name="description" content="&lt;rant&gt;You’ve got to admire the IMS/ISC sticking in there in the fight for the .org TLD. Even though ICANN has stated publicly they are bound and determined to treat .org not as a community resource, but as a corporate giveaway to the line the pockets of the goons already running the current registration systems , as long as said goons agree to make ICANN look good by laundrying the money through some high profile charity like the Red Cross. ICANN claims to think the authors of BIND, DHCP, the operator of the F Root Server, and the only applicant to show up with an already fully functional registry lacks technical competence, but the new baby Verisigns with an a collective average of 7.8 months expirence, and an undercapitalization problem should be just fine. Is this a not so subtle attempt to give .org back to Verisign or to simply kill it all together? Okay, I should stop ranting, and turn you over to the IMS/ISC’s well articulated response to the dismissal of their application. (but make sure to watch for the part where they talk about how ICANN hired Gartner Group [not to mention Arthur Andersen] to do the evaluation, at the same time Gartner was already working for Verisign)&lt;/rant&gt;" />
