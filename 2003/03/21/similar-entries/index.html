    <p>Way back in the frozen, blighted wasteland that was January this year, I was playing with building a “Similar Pages” functionality to be part of the proposed IMC open editing/annotations project, in the hopes of getting around the much noted fact that <a href="http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm">people suck at metadata</a>. In the process I discovered my Linear Algebra is more then a little rusty.</p>

<p>The great (and sometimes immensely frustrating) part of the web is often if you wait long enough, someone else will do all the hard work. And so it was. When I finally got around to reading Maciej Ceglowski’s (lead troublemaker in the <acronym title="latent semantic indexing">LSI</acronym> revolution) article, <a href="http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/2003/02/19/engine.html">Building a Vector Space Search Engine in Perl</a> I found all my work had been done for me, and laid out in a clean Perl module.</p>

<h3 id="blog-as-test-bed">Blog as test bed</h3>

<p>Well an open editing server is still an idea on low simmer, but I’ve got a blog, so LM (and all you folks) are now the guinea pig. Please check the individual entry archives to see what I’m talking about.</p>
<h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3>

<p>There have been several <a href="http://www.kalsey.com/2002/07/related_entries_plugin/">Related Entries</a> plugins released for Moveable Type, but I never found these very useful as they: didn’t match how I use categories, or would have required me going back and adding keywords to every entry. Besides they involved not a single matrix transformation. ### Hacking</p>

<p>I love object-oriented programming. Using Maciej’s <a hef="http://www.perl.com/2003/02/19/examples/VectorSpace.pm">Search::VectorSpace</a> with MT was almost as simple as subclassing in, and overriding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_words()</code>. (In the end I had to make some minor tweaks to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search()</code> as well) 40 minutes and 40 lines of code later I was happily building vectors of MT entries, and calculating similarities. Building a script to call my new Search::VectorSpace::MT took significantly longer <img src="http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" />### Next Steps</p>

<p>I wouldn’t call the code release ready. Already I’m noticing some problems, like I should be stripping HTML before calculating similarity. (should have been obvious) Also I currently haven’t jumped through the hoops to make this a Moveable Type plugin, though I think maybe a cron’ed crawler, plus some liberal use of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtapi_mt_plugindata.html">MT::PluginData</a> might be the best way to go. In the mean time I need to tweak it a little bit, find the right threshold, figure out the best way to respect the metadata I <strong>do</strong> have, etc, etc. If you see any particular bad, or particular good results, let me know. Thanks. <strong>update</strong>[2003/03/22]: yeah, its not working very well. i think i need to play with term weighting, that and strip that HTML.</p>
