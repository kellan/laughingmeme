Mix in another CJR article this time on the failure of the alt. weeklies (via mediageek), ostensibly the professionalized progressive media, to live up to their promise, and attempts by The Dominion and the New Standard, a new subscription based progressive news outlet, (via anarchogeek) to add more professionalism back into the mix (in different ways) and there is definitely an entry just waiting to be written.
