    <p>So we got our first real taste of summer weather these last few days. Its was lovely, though I have to wonder what happened to Spring? (by all reports it should be winter again tomorrow) But in the mean time, one of my favorite parts of the season, something I look forward to all winter, some people celebrate with the first ice cream cone of the season, I get an iced coffee.</p>

<p>Which is why it was disheartening today to order an iced coffee at Espresso Royale, and get served an iced americano. Americano has its place, and if you don’t have iced coffee fine, say so, but when I want a shot of espresso, diluted, and poured over ice, I’ll ask for it.</p>

<p>For the record the alternative is to cold brew the coffee. Sort of like sun tea, but different. Instead of using hot water, which when chilled will turn bitter, you use cool water, a coarse grind, and a much longer steeping period. (overnight works well, as goes one of those big, food grade white buckets if you’ve got a drinking problem)</p>

<p>(several people have nagged me that “I’m giving away the secret”, I’m not, this much is, or at least should be [hence the post] common knowledge. For a <strong>perfect</strong> cup, the devil is in the details)</p>
