<h3 id="capitalist-mindset">Capitalist Mindset</h3>

<p>In ensuring discussion all sorts of wonderfully capitalist metaphors about accured interest, natural costs, and competive advantage have floated to the surface. So here are a couple of more, <a href="http://perl-rss.sourceforge.net/">XML::RSS</a> has an overwhelming mindshare, and namespace lockout in the Perl community, giving us a virtual monopoly. Its true <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">Amphetadesk</a>, an RSS aggregator written in Perl, chose to go its owny way, and perhaps that proves Mark’s point for the niche market of aggregators.(which is a loud, and very profile market I give you that) But there is still a lot of demand from people who aren’t aggregators and I feel like XML::RSS should be able to do something with its market power. Think Microsoft, but in a good way <img src="http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" />### A few thoughts on making things better</p>

<ol>
  <li>Help people produce valid feeds. XML::RSS was one of the biggest offenders in this regard. It actively worked against people, unescaping their HTML entities, and not re-escaping this. This has been fixed in the next release.</li>
  <li>Give helpful error messages when parsing fails. In the long term it would be nice to port the <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/">RSS Validator</a> to be part of the toolkit to tell people <strong>exactly</strong> whats wrong with the feed. Feed consumers might be more outspoken if they knew why the feed broke and whose fault it was. Despite <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000290.html#000290">my minor gripes</a> about it, the RSS Validator is a very powerful tool.</li>
  <li>Until we port the Validator, perhaps when RSS hits a parsing error, we can say. &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSS parsing error on line 345, column 12</code> [like we do now, plus]
    <blockquote>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">For more info on why parsing failed see: http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check?url=http://someurl/index.rdf</code></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Now that XML::RSS has a <a href="http://perl-rss.sf.net">webpage</a>, we should be putting up articles, and links to articles showing best practice, and talking about pitfalls.</li>
  <li>Other ideas?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-are-the-toolkits">What are the toolkits?</h3>

<p>What are people using to parse RSS these days? Python has Mark N.’s <a href="http://www.mnot.net/python/RSS.py">RSS.py</a> and Mark P.’s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/rss_parser/">rss_parsrer</a>, PHP has hundreds of solutions, and lots of doing it by hand, but I think <a href="http://php.resourceindex.com/detail/00884.html">PHP-RSS</a> was close to a standard, and I think <a href="http://magpierss.sf.net">MagpieRSS</a> is gaining acceptance. What do people use in Java? In C? In those other languages? What does <a href="http://ranchero.com">NetNewsWire</a> use? And all these Windows aggregators? Yup still, geeking out on RSS despite what I said yesterday.</p>
