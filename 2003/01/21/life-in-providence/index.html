    <h3 id="cold">Cold</h3>

<p>I think perhaps I have mistakenly moved to Antartica. My book shelf is crammed with tropical books, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0394561619"><cite>Love in the Time of Cholera</cite></a>, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0140259198"><cite>Island of the Day Before</cite></a>; warm books whose re-reading I thought would bring me through the Winter months. I did not however expect <strong>this</strong> Winter. 50 mph winds blow through the deserted Providence streets, at mid-day as I hiked across town to White Electric the hardware store claimed it was 19 degrees, but we knew better, more like 12 I think. (though Weather.com claims that the high today was 19, and its currently “15 degrees, feels like -2”) Warm climes seem so foreign and remote that these books are nonsenical, and imcompreshensibly alien. Instead I’ve dived into <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0765303884"><cite>White Apples</cite></a> with its main character who is returned from the dead. That seems much more familiar. ### Prov</p>

<p>Other then that life is good. As previously mentioned in this space, <a href="http://www.as220.org/goulis/whitelec.html">White Electric Coffee Shop</a>continues to provide for my most basic needs (coffee, power outlets, people), <a href="http://www.cablecarcinema.com/">Cable Car Cinema</a> is a funky cafe, and movie theater whose claim to fame is lots and lots of couches, better if you go with a date, but I scored a big comfy arm chair for the solo expirence of watching <a href="http://www.rabbitprooffence.com.au/">Rabbit-Proof Fence</a>, which was a beautiful, superb, shocking, and eventually uplifting movie. The most intense emotional impact came in the epilogue which mentioned that the Australian government’s policy of kidnapping mixed blood children continued up until 1970. That isn’t history! That is only a few years before I was born! (be warned by the way, that not everyone found it uplifting, some have found it grim and depressing. <cite>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</cite>, it ain’t. I’m strange like that. I consistently reccomend <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0449912558"><cite>The Sparrow</cite></a> as one of the warmest, most funny books I’ve ever read, and people keep returning it to me with horrified looks on their faces) <a name="hugoweaving"></a></p>

<h3 id="hugo-weaving">Hugo Weaving</h3>

<p>Speaking of Priscilla, Josh mentioned the other night that his only real problem with Fellowship of the Ring was that <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Weaving,+Hugo">Agent Smith was cast as Elrond</a>. &gt; <cite>My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you want to do the right thing. It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Baggins, and that you are interested in the future. </cite></p>

<p>As I had already dealt with the image of a chorus line of Agents in sunglasses and pink frocks lip-syncing to Abba, I had the mental plasticity to cope with FotR casting.</p>
