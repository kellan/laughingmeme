<h3 id="3-bees">3 Bees</h3>

<p>As I sat in a patch on the grass in a patch of white clover this morning, I was surrounded by bees crawling over and around the white flowers. Happily content for the company, I was saddened to notice that 3 of the bees closest to me had Varroa mites. Mites, and harsh weather have wiped out wild honey bees, and severely reduced the numbers of domestic hives, a honey bee holocaust. Wanting to now surround myself with bees, I finally resolved to go find a good picture of bees, and honey, and flowers, and comb, so I visited <a href="http://istockphoto.com">iStockPhoto.com</a>, without much confidence, as I never seem to find what I’m looking for on stock photo sites. Pleasantly surprising them was to find that <a href="http://istockphoto.com/design_spotlight_details.php?ID=148">Honey – Natural Remedies</a> is the featured design of the week, and hilights a number of good images.</p>

<p><a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2003_07_06_archive.shtml#105800678311761620">Matt also saw a bee</a>, and by extension the same bee turned up on my laptop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday morning, hot sun and hot pavement, I found a dead bee. I can’t remember the last time I saw a dead bee – not since I’ve lived in a city, I guess – and this one was still brightly coloured, fuzzy and fat. I poked it with a piece of leaf for a while. That knot of complexity!…I witnessed a bee, not built on top of reality but part of reality itself. Indivisible from it. A window to the true reality so far from me. “Auspicious event! Going to be a good day” I texted Es, excited. “Not for the bee” she replied.</p>
