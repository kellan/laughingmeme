    <p>Read <a href="http://rickwebb.tumblr.com/post/106007409729/the-books-i-read-in-2014">Rick’s</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/content-consciousness/books-i-read-in-2014-47f528451836">Rachel’s</a> and <a href="http://blog.dianakimball.com/post/106214213693">Diana’s</a> year end book list, and got inspired to write up my own.</p>

<p>2014 was a year of extenuating circumstances, the most obvious being the arrival of Anwen 9 hours before it began, but numerous others large and small abound. Reading this year was centered around escape, even oblivion, in short doses, and re-reading featured prominently.</p>

<p>(also I finally forwent the urge to build a Kindle exporter as part of this process and just used <a href="https://www.clippings.io">clippings.io</a> which did the job well, though seems to have hit a problem after downloading nearly 2400 highlights)</p>

<p>Additionally I’ve probably missed a couple which I didn’t highlight anything in (or read exclusively in dead tree)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot by Robert Macfarlane</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Pilgrim paths, green roads, drove roads, corpse roads, trods, leys, dykes, drongs, sarns, snickets – say the names of paths out loud and at speed and they become a poem or rite – holloways, bostles, shutes, driftways, lichways, ridings, halterpaths, cartways, carneys, causeways, herepaths.</p>

      <p>In Ireland there are hundreds of miles of famine roads, built by the starving during the 1840s to connect nothing with nothing in return for little, unregistered on Ordnance Survey base maps. In the Netherlands there are doodwegen and spookwegen – death roads and ghost roads – which converge on medieval cemeteries. Spain has not only a vast and operational network of cañada, or drove roads, but also thousands of miles of the Camino de Santiago, the pilgrim routes that lead to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela. In Scotland there are clachan and rathad – cairned paths and shieling paths – and in Japan the slender farm tracks that the poet Bash? followed in 1689 when writing his Narrow Road to the Far North</p>

      <p>She had never felt older than those years when the children were small and so demanding of her attention. She had felt it a new lease on youth when they were grown and gone,</p>

      <p>In November of 1966 there was a flood in Florence, killing six people and damaging some property. Fortunately the weather computers had predicted it well in advance, so most people had evacuated and most works of art were moved to safety. Some frescos were damaged. Pat wrote articles about their restoration and sat on a committee to raise money for it.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Shallan moved her eyes down to the bottom of the page where—separated by a line—the undertext was written in a small, cramped script. Most books dictated by men had an undertext, notes added by the woman or ardent who scribed the book. By unspoken agreement, the undertext was never shared out loud. Here, a wife would sometimes clarify—or even contradict—the account of her husband. The only way to preserve such honesty for future scholars was to maintain the sanctity and secrecy of the writing.</p>

      <p>When he passed, the timid grass pulled back, but the fingermoss was bolder. The clumps would only pull into their shells if he tapped the rock near them.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“When we drove off the cliff, we left no skid marks.</p>

      <p>The people who stay will care deeply about how you treat their colleagues.</p>

      <p>Yes, of course. The reason that people leave our service and don’t come back is that we have not been sending them enough spam. That makes total sense to me, too.</p>

      <p>Shock is a great mechanism for behavioral change.</p>

      <p>Hiring scalable execs too early is a bad mistake. There is no such thing as a great executive. There is only a great executive for a specific company at a specific point in time.</p>

    <p>Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders, L. David Marquet</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Most of what we study, learn, and practice in terms of leadership today follows this leader-follower structure. This model has been with us for a long time. It is pervasive. It is the structure depicted in The Iliad, in Beowulf, and in other Western epics. But this model developed during a period when mankind’s primary work was physical. Consequently, it’s optimized for extracting physical work from humans. Those who take orders usually run at half speed, underutilizing their imagination and initiative. While this doesn’t matter much for rowing a trireme, it’s everything for operating a nuclear-powered submarine.</p>

    <p>The Privilege of the Sword (The World of Riverside Book 2), Ellen Kushner</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“I do not make the rules,” he said creamily. “This annoys me, and so I comfort myself by breaking them.</p>

      <p>Getting the long sword into the soft scabbard was a bit like getting a bootie onto a baby’s foot: neither was very interested in helping,</p>

      <p>And suddenly, as the night air turned cold and the day sky burned a bright and gallant blue, the world was full of apples. The air smelt of them, sharp and crisp, then underlaid with the sweet rot of groundfall.</p>

      <p>Serious sword-practice made me forget to think in words, so that I didn’t always understand when people spoke to me.</p>

      <p>She had a sudden vision of Jesus, who’d asked His disciples to keep doing this in remembrance of Him, watching her little congregation as they floated in microgravity and drank reconstituted grape beverage out of suction bulbs.

    <p>The Boy Kings: A Journey into the Heart of the Social Network, Katherine Losse</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Logging on to Facebook that first day, in retrospect, was the second, and to date the last, time that any technology has captured my imagination.</p>

      <p>“California is a place in which a boom mentality and a sense of Chekhovian loss meet in uneasy suspension; in which the mind is troubled by some buried but ineradicable suspicion that things better work here, because here, beneath the immense bleached sky, is where we run out of continent.</p>

      <p>While they abhorred the idea of being a wage slave, the young men of Silicon Valley were not trying to tear down the capitalist system. They were trying to become its new masters.</p>
