Hi,

I’m Kellan. I made my first website in 1994. This is the lightly updated version.

I think a lot about software and leading engineering teams, complex systems, and engineering capacity for social change. Lately I’m thinking more climate change and healthcare.

I advise, and coach a handful of organizations who want more effective and higher impact engineering organizations. I occasionally invest.

Any of those topics interest you? Get in touch.

Previously VPE Dropbox, SVP Blink Health, CTO Etsy, Flickr Architect, Tides Foundation Engineer, Palm Computing Principal Engineer, MetaEvents Founder.

Technical solutions for social problems. A's dad. Hope before optimism.

For fun: 🚴 ☕ 🥾 📚 🎭
