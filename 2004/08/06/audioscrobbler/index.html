    <p>With a track record of 508 songs I finally got my first set of recommendations from <a href="http://audioscrobbler.com">AudioScrobbler</a> last night.

<h3 id="a-few-thoughts-on-audioscrobbler">A few thoughts on AudioScrobbler</h3>

<p>It’s a neat project clearly suffering from a lack of resources. I’ve tried a few times over the last year to sign up, and download the appropriate plugins, early this week (just before the <a href="http://wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64402,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4">Wired article</a> probably caused their load to spike again) I was finally successful, but I worry about the long term health and stability of the servers.</p>

<p>There is a note at the bottom of each that the data is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">NonCommercial-ShareALike</a> license. Making the data available under a CC license is obviously the right thing to do. After all why would we spend energy building someone else’s database, we all learned better after Gracenote/CDDB, right? What I’m not seeing is any way to download this data in a useful format. I want to see the option for me to download all of my data, and also the entire database (probably anonymized), to experiment with (perhaps inventing a better recommendation engine?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>data wouldn’t have to be live, periodic dumps would be fine</li>
  <li>dump it as text (presumably RDF, maybe as XML), and bzip2 it, and it won’t cause bandwidth issues</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m using a variant of these instructions for <a href="http://fuddland.org.uk/archives/2004/04/27/audioscrobbler.php">fetching AudioScrobbler recently played info with Magpie</a>, on my <a href="/about/">about page</a></p>
