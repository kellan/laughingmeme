<p>I found myself repeatedly searching the LM archives for these tools, and I decided to pull then all together. All web based, all designed to help those of us that perhaps don’t have the “perfect pitch” for color that talented designers often display. (And its much harder to have Jasmine vet things for me from 3000 miles away)</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.pixy.cz/apps/barvy/index-en.html">Color scheme builder</a> – excellent. I use this frequently. Lighten, darken, warm, cool. Color blindness aware.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/">Color blend</a> – choose two colors, choose the number of midpoints, and get a gradient of RGB colors.</li>
  <li><a href="http://color.twysted.net/">ColorMatch: Slider based scheme builder</a> – shared themes, good defaults, display in place, export as Photoshop/Illustrator</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html">A simpler color scheme builder</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.istockpro.com/file_search.php?action=color&amp;text=&amp;color=2,9,2">Stock photos by color</a> – I don’t tend to use much in the way of photos, but I should. Also useful for picking up textures. (like the feathers from that Carnival photo)</li>
