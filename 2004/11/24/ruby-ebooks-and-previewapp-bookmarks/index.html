    <p><a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com">Rabble</a> is one of the hardest core Perl fans I know. Even when we were working together for Palm as Java programmers he was still writing Perl (which is something of a feat). So I’ve watched his enthusiastic uptakes of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> (and in particular <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/show/HomePage">Rails</a>) with a mixture of curiosity and alarm . In fact it seems like a huge percentage of the really smart people I know are all learning or using Ruby. Now I’m on a bit of a self imposed “travel ban” when it comes to working on non-PHP projects, but with 4 hours to kill in the airport (Jasmine’s flight is delayed) I figured now was the time. But this blog post isn’t about Ruby (yet), its about eBooks.</p>

<p>First thing I did was I bought the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Programming Ruby</a> ebook. Pragmatic Programmers have gone a very nice route with their copy protection. They don’t lock, or encrypt, or in some other way hobble the PDF. I can copy it, and print it, and general own it. I can even “loan” it. But my name is on the bottom of every page so I have an incentive to tightly control access to it. This is good, and smart and embracing the possibilities of a new medium. eBooks aren’t ever going to take off as long as their publishers cripple them.</p>

<h3 id="pdfs">PDFs</h3>

<p>I’m less enthused about the choice of PDF as the distribution medium. I’d be curious as to why this choice was made? I spend a huge amount of my day reading online in Firefox, I’m comfortable with it, the quality of the display is excellent (at least on OS X), and I don’t have to launch a special application. I know I like reading books as HTML because I have experience doing this both with Baen, and with the O’Reilly bookshelves. (does anyone know a good script to produce properly formatted and linked HTML from a PDF?)</p>

<h3 id="bookmarks-please">Bookmarks Please</h3>

<p>If I was on Linux or Windows a PDF would be <strong>useless</strong> to me. Thankfully I’ve got a Mac, and as I spend more time with Preview.app I am more and more impressed with it. Its fast, its light on memory usage, its responsive, the text rendering is gorgeous. Odd how Apple can produce a better PDF reader then Adobe. The one thing I’m really missing is <strong>bookmarks</strong>. Apple, can we get some bookmarks in Preview? I’ve got a back button, and a previous and next commands, but I’m reading through an 800 page PDF and I need bookmarks. ### A Bit More on Ruby</p>

<p>Okay I’ve spent 20 minutes playing with Ruby, and 20 minutes grinding my axe about ebooks, but I have to say what I’m most impressed by is Ruby’s ability to learn from others. Just one example, I learned Python sitting in idle playing iteratively. I’m very happy to find irb, and am having a similar experience.</p>
