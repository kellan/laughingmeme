<p>By 7:30 however its as busy as most coffee shops ever get, by 8:30 I imagine it will be the wall to wall people I associate with Zoka.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sedesdraconis/">Aidan</a> and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/architeuthisdux/">Kate</a> got off to an early start on the next leg of their road trip without restorting to truck stop coffee, and I have two new words to add to my lexicon, rosette (as in “they even rosette their hot chocolate!”), and fictive (e.g. “he has a fictive understanding of events”).</p>
