    <p>In the ebb and flow of spam, I’m definitely on the upswing these last two days. I’ve gone from an average of one message a day slipping through to having 10 slip through today. And in the last 2 hours since I cleaned up my spam trap, I’ve gotten 120 new spams. (i.e. flagged as spam, but low enough scored that they weren’t immediately consigned to oblivion)</p>

<p>Scariest of all, several of the messages which arrived today, came in perfectly clean, one with a -10.4 score from SpamAssassin.</p>

<p>Anyone else seeing this?</p>

<p><strong>update:</strong> Looking through my inbox there are three heurisitics which match 90% of the spam that made it through my filters, and only has 3 false positives in the last 10 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Claim to be sent from Windows</li>
  <li>I’ve never gotten email from them before</li>
  <li>Wasn’t to a mailing list. (another 8% were to mailing lists, but so were a whole bunch of messages written on Windows)</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly the solution is to block all email that claims to be sent from Windows! This would also cut down on those annoying virus messages as well. (though in truth I would have been bummed to have missed those 3 messages)</p>

<p>More seriously I am thinking about bouncing any message with a SpamAssassin score higher then 2 to my suspicious folder, half way between clean and spam, as looking over my inbox most of the message I really want to see have spam scores of -20 or more.</p>
