    <p>A particularly profligate spammer (with an odd habit of spamming me with URLs that resolve to 127.0.0.1), plus the growing awareness that I was falling down on my maintenance routines of deleting spam comments and blacklisting URLs, pushed me to write a new script last night, one to which I can forward the ‘New Comment Posted’ notifications for spam comments, and have it blacklist the URLs, delete the comment, and rebuild the entry. (ideally would also blacklist the IP)</p>

<p>An aside: this was my first time using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Email-Simple">Email::Simple</a> from the Perl Email Project (no website?) as suggested to me by <a href="http://aaronland.info">Aaron</a> many months ago, and it lived up to its name – it was simple.</p>

<p>That said the rest of this script, while quick and dirty (and sure to be a candidate for Kellan’s First Law of Blogging About Code: <em>When using a sufficiently expressive programming language it should be faster to write the code then explain it in a blog entry.</em>) is not simple install, see MT-Blacklist for that.</p>

<p>The trickiest part was getting the script to run with enough permissions to be able to update the blacklist, and overwrite an individual archive. I wanted to be able to just add a line like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">die-spammer: |/path/to/comment-spam.pl</code> to my aliases file, but Postfix, in its wisdom, was running my script as nobody. Then I tried setuid’ing the script (with my sysadmin’s bleary permission, the 3 hour difference means I can hit him with these questions on his way to bed), but Postfix again, in its wisdom, blocked me. So I’m calling it from procmail with the following rule:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
:0f: comment-spam.lock
* To: die-spammer
| /path/to/comment-spam.pl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which is unfortunately a “non-delivering” rule, which means I have to add a second rule to /dev/null the messages. The other slightly annoying problem is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MT::App::Comments::post()</code> is a single monolithic method, with neither methods, nor a template for constructing the notification emails. So to add the comment ID to the notification emails I had to copy over the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post()</code> method. (I should check if Jay has a solution to this)</p>

<p>Anyone interested, here is the script: <a href="/comment-spam.pl.txt">comment-spam.pl</a>. Ideally it should probably check the from address, as some sort of safe guard.</p>

<p>And here is the patch to MT::App::Comments:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
