Fascinating sounding (to those of us inside said complex) conference this April in Santa Barbara: [The Revolution Will not be Funded: Beyond the Non-profit Industrial Complex.](http://www.incite-national.org/conf/index.html "Color of Violence Conference") (via [jon](http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/archives/000971.html))

It will however, apparently, <blink>&lt;blink&gt;</blink>. And not just one word, but the whole page. Presumably theyâ€™ll get some positive feedback about this, and then the rest of us will be able to read the rest of the page.
