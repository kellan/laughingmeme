### No RSS, No Content Creation

The “Add your $0.02” feature is interesting. More micro-content creation. If I’m going to be blogging, even if it’s just loose change, I want an RSS feed of my, and my friends 2-cent comments. Something that I can stitch together with my the rest of the micro-content, from [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/kellan) commentary, to [43 Things](http://43things.com) entries, Amazon book reviews, and my [coffee shop reviews](http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?Kellan) from WifiMug. ### Seeing Stars

I never know how to use a 5-star rating system, but the friends system exposes Netflix’s underlying assumptions about what the stars mean, 3-stars is “I like it”. 2-stars and down is a negative rating, 3-stars and up is a positive rating.
