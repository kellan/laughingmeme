The NWS recently [decloaked](http://www.quicktopic.com/em/H/aZRarGycKBuyE/m18) their experimental [RSS feeds of weather watches, warnings, and alerts](http://weather.gov/alerts/). They are [soliciting feedback](http://weather.gov/survey/nws-survey.php?code=rss-cap-wwa) until Dec. 30th.

Check it out, and if you think it is cool as I do, and you think that the [National Weather Service](http://weather.gov) should be producing weather information in a public, easily accessible format, instead of having to buy that information from some commercial company, then you should contact them and tell them how excited you are to see this service. (because you know the vendors are going to scream when they see it)

Now that the NWS is almost ready to start issuing weather data on a 5kmx5km grid, Bob has said that they see their “future more like you give us a lat/long and we feed back xml for that ‘gridpoint’.” How cool is that?
