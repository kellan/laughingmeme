Well we poured the foundation, and have built most of the frame. Arcata was a strange and distracting time. Still the Protest.net re-write is coming well. Its good to be working in Perl again, and even better to be working in clean, OO perl, with rationale class hierarchies, and exception handling. The project is also starting to generate some excitement, and I think its the collaboration aspect of the software that people are most intrigued by, people no longer think of the web as a landscape of fortresses to keep out all other, but as something that interoperates, perhaps a sea, dotted with islands, and steady flow of people and trade passing between them in dugout canoes. I would say we’re about 2 weeks away from initial code release (“release early, release often” balanced by “only release running code”), probably a solid month, or more, away from a feature ready version 2. Hopefully we can find some money to sustain life, and free up the time to do the work.

I should stop procrastinating, there is a car to pack, we’re supposed to make it to Salt Lake City today, and to Boulder the day after were we hope to fix the Indymedia nameserver which got hit hard by apache/ssl worm, we have promises to keep, and miles to go before we sleep.
