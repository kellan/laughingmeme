You probably saw last weeks popular [loss of email more stressful then divorce](http://boingboing.net/2003_07_01_archive.html#200443803) meme. I don’t buy it. (not that I’ve been divorced)

However I do struggle with my own form of internet addiction. Faced with a long period of being offline (say the 50 minutes it takes me to get from Boston to Providence) I put off leaving, and put off leaving, looking around for something, anything else to do online before heading out. Is there any new email? Any new items in the aggregator? How about new posts at those sites without RSS feeds? Any new email?

Or, for example, posting this, when the train is leaving in 10 minutes.
