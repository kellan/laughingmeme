I just noticed that my resume is getting between 200-300 views a week, mostly from people searching for “resume software engineer”, but also searching for “resume web developer” (page 3), and various combinations involving more specific technologies like JSP, PHP, MySQL, and XML. (and one disappointed soul who searched for “resume san francisco postgres”, sorry can’t help you)

I was just thinking, thats pretty serious traffic, I wonder if I could sell access to display someone else’s resume at http://laughingmeme.org/resume.html, while perhaps continueing to display the original to Google? I wonder what the rate would be for something like that.
