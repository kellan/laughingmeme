Three great links via [Josh of Stone Cottage](http://stonecottage.com/josh/).

- [Migrating to Subversion](http://www.dehora.net/journal/archives/000289.html) – the ability to rename files! sane tagging! directory aware! Some notes on the mental transition to using Subversion.
- [Conditional GETs in Java](http://www.hackdiary.com/archives/000028.html) – for once, almost as simple as Perl.
- [Source code of note takers](http://miscoranda.com/59) – sounds like Sean is incrementally working his way towards [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/), and releasing the source as he goes.
