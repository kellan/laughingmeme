[Ted](http://www.sauria.com/blog) has mentioned that the [Tom Bihn Brain Bag](http://www.tombihn.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=TB0104&Category_Code=300&Product_Count=1) is [official <acronym title="Apache Software Foundation">ASF</acronym> wear](http://www.sauria.com/blog/gadgets/675).

Yesterday marked the 8th year I’ve been carrying a laptop in my Tom Bihn messenger bag.

The bag is still holding up great, though the laptop has had to be replaced a few times. (though that isn’t the bag’s fault considering what I put my laptops through. Getting misplaced in the Australian outback was just one of the misadventures the first resident of the bag, my PowerBook 100, suffered.) I recommend accessorizing with a [Courierware laptop sleeve](http://courierwareusa.com/level.itml/icOid/13), as an alternative to the Bihn’s bulkier [Brain Cell](http://www.tombihn.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=001&Product_Code=TB0300) (nee LapDog), though if I had to do it again, I would seriously consider the Doctrow approved [R.A.P.S.! Protection System](http://www.roadwired.com/store/product.cfm?productid=60) for the insert.

A photo, circa 1996, of a styling Super Musette bag.
