Congrats to \[waferbaby\](http://waferbaby.com/), \[mroth\](http://mroth.info/), and \[ph\](http://www.paulhammond.org/journal/) for totally owning on today’s \[friend importing feature\](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/03/31/find-your-friends/) (aka beehive).

We’re a little late to the game but its awfully nice to be able to launch with zero screenscraping, and zero phishing-creepy-give-us-your-password. This is what data-portability-open-data-delegated-trust future looks like.

**update:** and yes, we’re cheating, because Yahoo’s addressbook API is still internal+partners only. We’re working on it.
