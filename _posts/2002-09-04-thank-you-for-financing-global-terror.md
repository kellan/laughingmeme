Great culture jam stickers allow you to [comment on our car culture.](http://subvert.us/thankyou/) I think the creator means it to be a commentary on Middle East terrorism, but I found myself thinking of [Occidental Oil](http://www.google.com/search?q=Occidental+Oil) and the U’wa, [Shell’s duplicity in the assasination of Ken Saro-wiwa](http://www.mosopcanada.org/text/ken.html), and many other cases. And the great thing about stickers is they’re cheap! (Unlike a television spot, or buying the NYTimes editorial page)
