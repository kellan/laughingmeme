We’ve had quite a bonanza of code released in the weeks since AdvocacyDev. People laugh when I talk about the “dotOrg boom”, but this is what I’m talking about folks.

- [AMP](http://radicaldesigns.org/) – the Acitivist Mobilization Platform. Everything you need to run a mass mobilization or grass roots political campaign. (PHP/MySQL, [download](http://radicaldesigns.org/amp-3.2.tar.gz))
- [AdvoKit](http://www.voter2voter.org/) – as Katrin put it [“a kick-ass P2P Coter ID and <acronym title="Get Out the Vote">GOTV</acronym> tool.”](http://techstrategy.typepad.com/emerging/2004/07/advokit_tools_f.html) (PHP/MySQL/Smarty, [AGPL](http://www.affero.org/oagpl.html), [download](http://cvs.voter2voter.org/releases/))
- [CivicSpace”](http://civicspacelabs.org/) – distributed community software, nee DeanSpace ([Drupal](http://drupal.org)-baseb, GPL, [download](http://civicspacelabs.org/download))
- [Democracy In Action](http://demaction.org/) – online campaign tools (Java/JSP, [AGPL](http://www.affero.org/oagpl.html), early release, [download](http://demaction.org/dia/download/))

Not at the get together, but very much present in spirit (perhaps without their consent), [TheyWorkForYou](http://theyworkforyou.com/), the British project to make legislature accessible, and accountable by allowing you to track their actual voting and debate record, has released [their code, and their data sets(!)](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/news/archives/2004/07/18/new_full_source_.php). (PHP/MySQL, GPL, [download](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/news/archives/2004/07/18/new_full_source_.php))

Notably all these tools, beyond being open source, focus on opening up new channels of communication and engagement, “open sourcing” the organizing process if you will.

More to come very soon.
