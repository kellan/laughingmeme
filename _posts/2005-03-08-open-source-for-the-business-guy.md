I was recently asked about a good book on open source for executives. I don’t think any exist. In some ways the lack of good books is inherent in the whole “open source” coinage; a hustle to make execs comfortable with what is actually going on, software libre.

However surfing this morning, I tripped over the [Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/#manifesto) which I hadn’t thought about it in years, and I think **that** might be a good first read for execs on open source and networks.
