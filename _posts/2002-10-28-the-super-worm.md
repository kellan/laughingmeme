Been meaning to blog about [Curious Yellow](http://blanu.net/curious_yellow.html). Its fascinating. Worms acting collaboratively, using the latest in peer-to-peer technology, as aaron said, “And if you’re going to, could you give me 24 hours notice? Thanks.”

In the meantime, I have only pleasant thoughts for [Slapper](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-958758.html?tag=fd_top), the first p2p worm seems in the wild. Admittedly it damaged the IMC nameserver, but it gave Josh and myself an excuse to stop in Boulder, see friends, play pool, and earn some gas money to finish driving across the country.
