I didn’t realize DOAP wasn’t out when [Jo](http://locative.net/workshop/index.cgi?Jo_Walsh) was proselytizing it at the [Aspiration convergence](http://advocacydev.org/) earlier this month. If I’d know that I’d have jumped on it, you know be one of those early mover cool kids. Now it is released, with a [web page](http://usefulinc.com/doap), and a [OSCON session + Danny O’Brien write up](http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2004/07/29#1091126400).

My initial feedback is that we’ve got to stop being so damned *cute* with our naming if this stuff is going to get wide adoption, FOAF, LOAF, DOAP, come on!

Still, [Magpie DOAP](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/doap.rdf) (hmm, have to see if I can use .htaccess to force proper content-type), courtesy of the [DOAP-a-matic](http://mouettes.balbinus.net/doap-a-matic.php). Really Sourceforge should spit this out automatically, in the mean time it would be a trivial hack to write a Sourceforge RSS to DOAP converter. (that was a hint)
