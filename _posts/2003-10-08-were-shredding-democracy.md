Wooohoo, join the fun. Missed out on the impeachment trials? Didnâ€™t get your chance to help rig the presidential elections? Well step on up, you can still do your part, and recall the governor of California! Admittedly that $9 billion that Enron owes the state is just the beginning of what the Governator will cost California, but what a small price to pay to be part of this new, exciting, political order that is sweeping the nation.

Just one question, what do you do for encore?
