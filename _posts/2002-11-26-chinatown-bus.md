“china town bus” and its variations are a consistent source of Google derived traffic I never quite expect, all landing on my [Chinatown &lt;-&gt; Chinatown](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000041.html) story, which is rather short on info.

 Since I posted that the Chinatown bus phenomena has crossed over into the mainstream, the buses are packed, they just got a [nod from the “Best of Boston”](http://www.bostonphoenix.com/supplements/the_best/02/detail.asp?cat=2&type=2&subcat=112) issue of the Phoenix, Greyhound has started running specially priced New York to Boston runs, and the Gotham Gazette has a garish article about [over competition](http://www.gothamgazette.com/citizen/aug02/original-chinatownbus.shtml).

Me, I’m taking the $40 roundtrip Northeastern shuttle this Thanksgiving.

**update:** since this time (for all you people who Google **keeps** sending here) the Chinatown buses have lowered their price to a flat $10 oneway.

Also some people might find my [JFK airport to Harvard Sq. (via Chinatown) for $13](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000776.html#000776) interesting.
