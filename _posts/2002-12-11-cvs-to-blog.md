Anyone written a cvs to blog tool? Something that works kind of like the cvs to email scripts, but instead of sending out an email containing the new commit info, blogs it.

Not sure if the best route is cvs-&gt;email-&gt;blog or a script that hooks into the various XML-RPC APIs for blogging.

I guess this is my attempt to see if [LazyWeb](http://iawiki.net/LazyWeb) works for those of us who arenâ€™t on the a-list.
