Not two hours ago I said that support for [Atom](http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-atom-format-02.html) wasn’t in Magpie’s near future – medium to long term sure, but not soon. Too much work with a still changing, and complicated spec, for too little gain.

I didn’t count on the intrepid [Scott Hanson](http://www.papascott.de) writing a patch to add [Atom support to Magpie and FoF](http://www.papascott.de/2004/01/03/2785.php).

Cool.
