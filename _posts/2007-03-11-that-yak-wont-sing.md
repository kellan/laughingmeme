[Enough frisbee](http://twitter.com/kellan/statuses/6813641), need to get a little work done this weekend. Need a good coffee shop with wifi **and** power on a Sunday.

Hmmm, really what I need to do is to finally get around to setting up a San Francisco [WifiMug](http://seattle.wifimug.org).

Which reminds me that I’m kind of unhappy with the current state of the WifiMug codebase (and it’s showing its age a bit, pre-Web 2.0!), guess I should research available Rails wiki software.

Though what I really should do is whip out that Wiki-meets-structured-data-creation-PlacesWiki I’ve been meaning to write.

But first I want to do a comprehensive survey of alternative wiki markups, the space has really fractured. [Stikkit](http://stikkit.com/) is doing good things with natural mark up, while [Semantic MediaWiki](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Semantic\_MediaWiki) steamrolls its way through the expressiveness sweet spot, and [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) wiki has some interesting stuff going on.

But, um, um, um, I should write a new web browser and search engine to research wikis! Yeah, thats the ticket!
