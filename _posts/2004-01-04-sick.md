### Wit

Being sick is bad enough. Being sick when your only companionship is the DVD [Wit](http://imdb.com/title/tt0243664/) in which Emma Thompson explores the symptoms of chemotherapy (and something about John Donne, wasn’t tracking very well). Hard to feel bad about throwing up, when you could be looking at 8 months of it, plus hair loss. Had to turn it off, was feeling too much sympathy. ### Salt

Mark Kurlansky’s [Salt: A World History](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0142001619) is fascinating, informative, fun, and well written. Unfortunately it is also populated with the most stomach turning (in my delicate state) discussion of how the Romans used to cure and serve meat. Put away until the sight of something other then water doesn’t make me queasy. Fwiw, they learned it all from the Celts.

### Coffee

I suppose it is a sign I’m feeling a bit better if I can complain about the intense caffeine headache that is crashing around inside my head, the proverbial bull in a china shop. I miss caffeinated water.
