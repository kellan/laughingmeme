There has been an assumption that we need to include support for RSS 2.0 in the next version of XML::RSS, but so far I haven’t seen much demand for it. Eric [asked for it](http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2002_12_15_index.html#90074048) today, but a quick search of `comp.lang.perl.*`, PerlMonks, etc, turns up very little that looks like that itch needs to be scratched. And certainly nothing has made it into the [official wishlist](http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=XML-RSS).

Eric pointed me to a potential [RSS 2.0 patch for XML::RSS](http://www.rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=4617).

And while I’m waiting for someone to write the [CVS to blog](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000247.html) tool, I’ve setup a cron job to maintain an [updated daily XML::RSS ChangeLog](http://dev.protest.net/~kellan/XML-RSS-ChangeLog). (update: better yet a [XML::RSS changelog as RSS](http://dev.protest.net/~kellan/cvs-rss/XML-RSS.rdf))
