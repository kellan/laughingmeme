Do not buy a Belkin router. There are perfectly decent, cheap wireless AP/router combos in the world. Not a Belkin.

Besides being crappy, ugly, poorly documented hardware, with a horrible configuration inteface, where they make up their own little mini-jargon rather then using standard terms, and besides the fact that we still haven’t been able to make the Mac talk to the router, Belkin is evil. They are showing popup ads for Belkin products on my home network! I understand the approach of APs out in the world proxying http requests to a login page, its a useful way to have a login, or share information about a project as I’ve mentioned.

But there is absolutely, no possible way to justify Belkin thinking they have the right to show advertisement on my home network simply because I’m using their crappy hardware.

**Belkin sucks. Do not buy one.** I’m going to go return this thing for the people I’m visiting and get them something decent. I think I would prefer 2 tin cans on a piece of string, but they might not realize it was an upgrade.
