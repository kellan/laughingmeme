    - "Why is Blizzard charging for the [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) software?  Or, barring the need to cover printing and shipping, why disallow me to use a copy I manage to acquire though alternative methods?  How can the $40 they collect up front possibly compare the to recurring amount they would receive if they lowered the barriers to participation?  Given that [a troll pidgin](http://www.tooskatribe.com/) is quickly becoming a viable 2nd language in this house, I\\'d happily pay $12/month fee to have an account for the occasional play, and I\\'d probably go on paying even on off months, to hold on to my limited progress.  \n\nHow long would I let these low level monthly payments go on?  It would roll right into my [cost of being online](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002408.html) without making a ripple, and they\\'d have already made their money and more.   Dumb, or at least short sighted."
