I assume everyone does this but Iâ€™ll blog it anyway. One of the best ways to find out the technology powering a well designed site is to generate an error condition.

Most sites litter clues as to their implementation all over the place, must to consternation of the [Cool URIs](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) school of thought, but its an interesting paradox that the sites that are the most interesting, and best implemented are the ones that are most silent about their underlying technology. `wget -S http://example.org` can sometimes tell you a bit, but you really need an error message to uncover the deep dark secrets.

I was reminded of this quite by accident today, when I ran into an error on [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us). The answer is [Mason](http://www.masonhq.com/), which I must say raises my estimation of Mason considerably. Now if only it was [open source](http://lists.burri.to/pipermail/delicious-discuss/2004-August/000780.html).
