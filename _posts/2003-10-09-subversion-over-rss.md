From the makers of Hydra, an eXSLT transformation that turns [Subversionâ€™s changelog into RSS](http://0x2a.no-ip.org/mt/archives/000044.html). (via [ranchero](http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&postid=833)) I always said svn2rss was going to be more elegant then [cvs2rss](/cvs2rss), but I never imagined it would be that unhackish. Cleary the SVN folks are doing something right.
