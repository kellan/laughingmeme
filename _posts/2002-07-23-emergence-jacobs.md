I just started reading [Emergence](http://www.booksense.com/product/info.jsp?isbn=0684868768) last night, and I begin to grasp why Jane Jacobs’ [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](http://www.booksense.com/product/info.jsp?isbn=0375508732), has started popping up on peoples’ reading lists everywhere.

*Death and Life* is a great book, I found it years ago, digging through my fathers urban planning collection. But until recently I would have thought it was a much cited, but little read classic from an earlier century, and I’ve been puzzled that it was expirencing a reniassance.

Has the recent gaps in the NYC skyline interested everyone in urban planning again? Nope. The book is just getting great marketting from *Emergence*, and its cheap to pick up at your local used bookstore.

Personally I got more of a kick out of reading her *“The Economy of Cities”*, which immediately sent me into throws of longing for a game that crossed SimCity and Civiliziation, though it had less to say, and was more speculative.
