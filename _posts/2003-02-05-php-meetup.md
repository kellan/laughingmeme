Well, against my better judgement I’ll be attending the [PHP meetup](http://php.meetup.com/hq/) in Boston tomorrow night. As I’ll already be kicking around looking for something to do it seemed silly not to go. And I’ll just have to keep my more….fervent…opinions of the PHP as a language and a community to myself.

On the bright side, the PHP meetup is staged in cafes, where many of them seem to happen in food courts, last months was (so I hear) in the always excellent Diesel. This month, and I think this is really why I’m going, its scheduled to take place at Mama Gaia’s, a performance space, and wirelessly enabled coffee shop, that was [seized and shut down almost 3 months ago](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000221.html#000221). Maybe we’ll sit in a circle on the sidewalk out front.

So, you should come.

**update:** Jazz is sick, I’m going to stay home and play doctor. You’ll just have to get along without me.
