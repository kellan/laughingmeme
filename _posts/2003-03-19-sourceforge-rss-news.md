Sourceforge unveiled a [major RSS upgrade](https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=15483&group_id=1) today. You can get feeds for everything that you would expect, site wide popular, recent, newly released, newly approved, and [project specific](http://sourceforge.net/export/rss2_project.php?group_id=55691) new releases, new documentation, new news.

They also provide a super cool, thinking-outside-the-box project summary feed, with the project description and various activity monitors(for example, [Magpie’s Project Summary Feed](http://sourceforge.net/export/rss2_projsummary.php?group_id=55691)) Everything you need for a little remote project display.

Noticeable in its absence is a CVS checkins feed, but that is [rather easy to solve](http://laughingmeme.org/cvs2rss).

Also Sourceforge is looking for the ultimate Web guru to move to that hell hole which is Fremont. If you have

> 5+ years of development experience on high end, high volume websites (3+ million page views a day) [and] as a vast level of knowledge of Internet technologies: PHP, PostgreSQL, MYSQL, DB2, Linux, PERL, Apache, LDAP, Mailman. A flare for design / UI is a bonus. [*ed. you can say that again!*]

…and are willing to live in Fremont, then you should apply! I want someone I know working there.
