How can [Wordsworth have closed](http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2004/12/01/closing_store_has_them_at_loss_for_words/ "Boston.com / A&E / Books / Closing store has them at loss for words")?. And why did nobody tell me?

Does that leave the [booksmith](<http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/ >) as the only independent, general selection bookstore in the area?
