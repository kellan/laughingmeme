[Rabble](http://www.anarchogeek.com) recently said in [Indymedia, Credibility, &amp; Covering Palestine](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000008.html#000008):

> *The NY Times is the bastion of credibility, their stories always reinforce a hegemonic perspective despite adherence to the ‘facts.’ Now many in alternative journalism want to out do the NY times, using the same objectivity but just replacing it with another paradigm for viewing the world.  I don’t think this will work for two reasons. First off they have almost all the money. Secondly we aren’t advocating the kind of world that will fit neatly in to one modernist perspective. Unlike the Marxist-Leninist of old who had THE answer, today we have many answers and even more questions. For a credible media to be created in this new networked, postmodern if you like, world **we need to fully reconstruct what we mean by credibility.***

[MediaGeek](http://mediageek.org) is also [talking about these ideas](http://www.mediageek.org/2002_04_01_archive_index.html#85026214), responding to this [“surprisingly fair and mostly accurate”](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25676-2002Apr21.html) article by the Washington Post.

WP:

> *in the end, crafting content requires selection, shortening, simplification and even a mildly **authoritarian editorial brain making decisions***

MG: > *Mainstream news organizations, like the Washington Post, are very concerned with creating an air of authority and maintaining the  **illusion** that their reporting is utterly consistent, complete, fair and authoritative… regardless of how well a story is researched, reported and written, it cannot be singularly authoritative — any such appearance is the just the effect of style that we have been trained to read as “objective” or “true.”*

Yeah. Thats what I’ve been trying to say!
