In the past I’ve found myself largely immune to the charms of Yale, but yesterday afternoon, waiting for an Alt. Media conference to kick off (good people, bad panels), I simply sunk into the luscious overstuffed couches in the lounge of Sage Hall. The mechanical clock ticking away the minutes reverberated nicely against the polished wooden walls. And several hours past happily as I struggled with Javascript, closures, recursion, and the inscrutable DOM. In fact I was so much in a different world that when it came to time to leave, I got up and left behind my power adapter! I didn’t realize this until getting home last night, 2 hours drive away (and I don’t drive), having stopped at a house warming party along the way. At 1 am I stood out on the rain swept streets of Providence declaiming my frustration to the impassive skies.

### Some Hope

There is [*another conference*](http://islandia.law.yale.edu/isp/democracy_conference_main.html) going on at Yale this weekend, some Internet and law conference, so the hope is that someone will bring my power adapter back to me. (is there an emoticon for squinching up for face, and crossing your fingers and hoping really hard?) ### In the mean time

In the mean time I’m baby-sitting a friend’s Windows XP machine. I offered to install a real operating system on it, but she turned me down. So while I know its not useful for much but running Mozilla and Putty, I figure **there must at least be a few good games for Windows. Any suggestions?** I’m looking for something in the classic [Ambrosia style](http://www.ambrosiasw.com), or maybe a Spaceward Ho. I’d grab a copy of Civ from somewhere but it doesn’t seem worth the effort to learn the intricate ins and outs of Window’s “file sharing” community. Thanks.
