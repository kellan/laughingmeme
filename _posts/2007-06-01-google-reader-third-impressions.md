So the promise of offline-ing is getting me to try to switch to reader, again. I stuck with through the night this time, so this might be the switch. (Though in truth my favorite part is I’ve only got 14 feeds in the aggregator so far.)

Couple of quick questions:

- Am I missing the easy “subscribe to saved blog search” feature? Or do I really need to leave the app to set that up?
- And where is search? Of *course* I can search all my read items, right? Where is it?
- Share is neat. Anybody got a good Reader shared items to del.icio.us script around?
- And an observation. Seems like it takes significantly longer for new items to show up then in Bloglines (at least for popular feeds). Which is weird, but as I’m trying to let go to the fast-twitch feed reading dependency maybe this will help.
