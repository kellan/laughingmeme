It is unneccessary to study philosophy when you have something like the web, which is both sufficient and complete.

Work your way through [Battleground God](http://philosophers.co.uk/games/god.htm), dodging key intellectual bullets. Speak knowingly about Pascalâ€™s Wager with this [handy story](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/stories/pascals_wagering.shtml), great for thesis reviews. More to come. (note: this will not help you with a degree in Continental Philosophy, for that we reccomend [alt.sex.stories](http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&safe=off&group=alt.sex.stories))
