Following [my last post](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002442.html#002442) it was pointed out to me that Martin Fowler did a [brief intro to closures last month](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Closures.html), including a handful of [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) examples. This was followed by [translations into C#](http://joe.truemesh.com/blog//000390.html), and [Python (two forms, simple and idiomatic)](http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000392.html). All of which brought home just how lovely Python’s list comprehension is. (how little I like statically typed languages) Maybe I should add list comp to [the list for PHP 6](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002442.html#002442)?

Strangely Fowler didn’t cover what I consider to be the most useful/powerful feature of closures, anonymous functions (aka “code refs” in Perl speak).

Rather then hard coding you’re looking for managers, as in Fowler’s example, ayou might instead create a factory method for searching for arbitrary employee types.

In Perl this might look like:

```
<pre class="code">
sub makeEmployeeFilter {
  my $type = shift;
  return sub { my $e = shift; return $e->isOfType($type); }
}

<p>$isManager = makeEmployeeFilter('Manager');
grep { $isManager->($_) } @emps;
</p>
```
