Just putting a note here for the next time Iâ€™m working with the \[Yahoo! GeoPlanet\](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/) APIs.

The conudrum: a HTTP GET on a given resource (`http://where.yahooapis.com/v1/place/23511846?appid=$appid`) works in the browser, and works with `wget` from the command line, but fails from within PHP with a `406 Not Acceptable`.

The solution, append `format=XML` to the resource URL, because the service is blowing out its brains on a missing `Accept`s header.

And that folks is the magic of REST.

**update 2008/12/04:** quick scan of my referer logs suggests this is biting folks using \[lwp-simple\](http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-5.821/lib/LWP/Simple.pm) and wget particularly hard.
