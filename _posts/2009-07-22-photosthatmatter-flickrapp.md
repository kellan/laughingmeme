Aaronâ€™s [FlickrApp](http://github.com/straup/gae-flickrapp/tree/master) is a brain dead easy to use subclass of [webapp.RequestHandler](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/handlingforms.html) that turns [Flickr](http://flickr.com) into an single-sign on service for [Google AppEngine](http://code.google.com/appengine/).

As a bonus, you get a valid Flickr auth\_token for every signed in user. This makes writing [Flickr API apps](http://flickr.com/services/api) about the simplest thing ever.

Case in point, I wrote the largely mis-named [photosthatmatter](http://photosthatmatter.appspot.com) app last night in slightly less then 20 minutes, while waiting for dinner to simmer. Shows the most interesting photo from each for your contact in a given time period. Great for catching up on things you missed as they flowed by the first time.

YMMV, but it works for me.
