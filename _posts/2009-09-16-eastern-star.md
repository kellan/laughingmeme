On a flight reading [Paul Theroux’s](http://www.paultheroux.com/) [Ghost Train](http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Train-Eastern-Star-Railway/dp/0618418873), a meditations on traveling and writing, and travel writing. The braying voice of an over-confident founder echoes around the too small spaces of the plane, pitching his social publishing platform to his seat mate; built on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) in India, *“we’re great for travel books, anything you can make a template for.”*

I don’t think Paul would approve.
