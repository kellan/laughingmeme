- [multi-sync](http://multisync.sourceforge.net/) looks like an interesting linux sync solution, looks like its focused on Bluetooh. Still haven’t found any open source conduits into Outlook.
- My favorite post about the proposal to remove RDF from RSS, Edd says, [Its too late, the “damage” has already been done](http://www.advogato.org/person/edd/diary.html?start=32)
- Speculation on what we might see in the [extended version of Two Towers.](http://dvd.ign.com/articles/381/381227p1.html)
- Nice technical write up on [IBOC, the FCC’s proposed digital radio standard](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/1/6/103819/9665), mentions the descision to use IBOC is being contested, and contrasts to EU147, the standard used by the rest of the world.
