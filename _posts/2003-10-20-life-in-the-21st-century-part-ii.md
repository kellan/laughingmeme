![](http://casorio.anarchogeek.com/images/flowers.gif)[Rabble](http://anarchogeek.com) continues to explore the [challenges and inevitable compromises](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000253.html) of inter-geek relationships.

“We put up a WikiWedding site at [casorio.anarchogeek.com](http://casorio.anarchogeek.com/) for those interested. There was some debate, I prefer a wiki for this kind of site, while [gaba](http://gaba.protest.net) was more inclined to go with moveable type and a blog format. In the end we have a blog which is private for tracking todo’s and related notes, and a wiki which is public. “

Certainly the first WeddingWiki I’ve encountered.
