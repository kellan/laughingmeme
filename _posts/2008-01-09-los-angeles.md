Jasmine and I headed to Los Angeles for the new year. And we had an amazing time. This is hard for me. As a native of Northern California I was raised to despise Los Angeles. (and really I’m more a Central/Southern California, but culturally we identified as NorCal.) Studies on environmentalism and conservation just reinforced the point.

<div class="twitter"><span class="entry-title entry-content">The state of California has recognized my ability to uphold the tradition of driving excellence for which it is known.</span><span class="meta entry-meta">[<abbr class="published" title="2007-12-26T22:51:55+00:00">02:51 PM December 26, 2007</abbr>](http://twitter.com/kellan/statuses/536088502)</span></div>Part of the deal for us going to LA was that I’d do a chunk of the driving as Jasmine’s wrist is sprained. This was problematic as I don’t drive, and didn’t have a license. So on Dec. 24th we spent some time driving, and on Dec. 26th I proved that CA will give a driver’s license to just about anyone. And Dec. 28th we drove the 350 miles to LA. And so ends a 15 year boycott of car culture.

The weather was great, we saw amazing art, we ate great food, we caught a good show, and saw good friends. We took a bunch of photos, I’ve got a \[small sampling of them\](http://flickr.com/photos/kellan/sets/72157603613465712/), and Jasmine has a more \[complete set\](http://flickr.com/photos/curlyjazz/collections/72157603660659972/).

The execution on \[his new work, Imperfect Union, is flawless, and gorgeous\](http://flickr.com/photos/curlyjazz/sets/72157603661206822/). Also sold out. Literally. Every piece was sold. We tried to beg/borrow/steal anything with \[War by the Numbers\](http://flickr.com/photos/kellan/2160245279/in/set-72157603613465712/) on it. Without success.

On paper doesn’t it look that large, but the live experience is different. Interesting to see his work all together, you realize how weak the painting is, and how amazing his sculpture is. The security presence was so intense, I almost felt like I was in a performance piece, the © in the show’s name being acted out as authoritarian dystopic future. Which is to say, we were only able to sneak a \[handful of photos\](http://flickr.com/photos/curlyjazz/sets/72157603670587040/). Or a plot to make you buy the catalog. (which we did)
