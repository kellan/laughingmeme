I stuck around for the first 30-40 minutes of the debate, before finding better things to do with my time.. The one and only thing that struck me as interesting was Bush’s talking point that [“being president is hard work”](http://overstated.net/projects/debates/index.asp?p=hard+work&f=on). I’m not sure what the political stratgey behind this is, but I for one was put in mind of a certain GI Joe doll [whining, “Math is hard”](http://www.sniggle.net/barbie.php).
