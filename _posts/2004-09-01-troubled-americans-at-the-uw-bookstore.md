Was planning to go see [Dave Eggers read tonight at 7](http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/trade.taf?dept=attribute&category=events&par=trade&ttl=events&page=1) from the new McSweeney’s anthology [Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400042240/), but a day of doing system administration is leaving me drained to the point that I’m debating now (at 4 in the afternoon) if I’m going to have the energy to pick up a beers on the way home. (I am not a sysadmin.)

However someone should go, and tell me how it is. I think Dave Eggers is interesting, even if <cite>Heartbreaking Work</cite> is officially the most pretension “favorite book” of my generation.
