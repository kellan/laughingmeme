> “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard people say they wouldn’t use Ruby because it lacks automated refactoring tools. Ruby doesn’t actually need them in the way Java does; it’s like refusing to switch to an electric car because there’s no place to put the gasoline.” – \[Steve Yegge on the NBL\](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html)
