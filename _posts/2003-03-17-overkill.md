Alright, one of you people is a little weird. Since I’ve started including the full content of posts in my feed, I’ve definitely seen an increase in aggregators. (and a decrease in page view) Thats fine.

But you, the one who is running RssBandit, nntp//rss, **and** something involving LWP, thats over doing it a bit. I promise I serve the same RSS feeds to all user-agents, really. One aggregator should be good enough.
