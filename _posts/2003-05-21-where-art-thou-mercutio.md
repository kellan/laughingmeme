All this commentary about how bad Matrix Reloaded is makes we want to go see it so I can get in on the act. How perverse the manufacture of culture is. Still, I’ve seen nary a comment on [Harold “Link” Perrineau](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Perrineau+Jr.,+Harold) who was such a memorable Mercutio in [Romeo+Juliet](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0117509). Any chance of getting a <cite>Dancing Queen</cite> reprise with him and Hugo Weaving?
