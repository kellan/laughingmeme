Three convicts facing the electric chair in New Mexico for the stabbing of a guard during a prison riot are citing [Greg Palastâ€™s](http://www.gregpalast.com/index.cfm) <cite>Best Democracy Money Can Buy</cite> and its [grim accounting of the push to privatize the prison system.](http://www.guerrillanews.com/corporate_crime/doc2099.html) (via [ambigous](http://www.ambiguous.org/archive.php3/2003/06/13#robin2003613.1))

White collar crime is treated by our a society as a largely harmless, covertly admired, part of the game of getting ahead while the punishment of blue collars crimes are an outlet for our collective rascism and hysteria. The real difference however lies in how many lives a white collar criminal can destory without ever knowing the names of their vicitims.
