“+1” is a convention that arose on the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org) mailing lists. The ASF still has the best, most functional process for mailing list based collaboration which has ever been evolved of which -1/0/+1 is only the thin wedge. (the whole vocabulary of `lazy consensus`, `commit-then-review`, etc is incredibly important when trying to implement a diversity of tactics over email, as we ran into time and time again with [Indymedia](http://www.indymedia.org)). Worth exploring [their process](http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html) in depth.

Anyway, [Google launched a “+1” product today](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/1s-right-recommendations-right-when-you.html), and there was some discussion as to where the “+1” convention came from. The first place I ever encountered it was this email from [Rob Hartill, on Wed, 15 Mar 1995](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod\_mbox/httpd-dev/199503.mbox/%3C9503152021.AA27714@ooo.lanl.gov%3E), as part of one of the early patch voting rounds on Apache 0.7.x (the Apache foundation having formed the previous month to turn NCSA httpd into Apache).

```
I'll use a vote of 
  -1 have a problem with it
  0 haven't tested it yet (failed to understand it or whatever)
  +1 tried it, liked it, have no problem with it.

```

Rob might have adapted it from an earlier source, but I’ve never seen it.
