I’ve been putting off commenting on [The Dominon](http://dominionpaper.ca/), a “grassroots national newspaper. In progress”, on the idea that I needed to come up with something properly clever to introduce this awesome, and ambitious project. I’ve given up on writing a proper introduction, go [read it](http://dominionpaper.ca/), it speaks for itself.

Quick overview: Excellent articles like [Dru’s](http://misnomer.dru.ca/) recent [A Dream Only American Power Can Inspire](http://dominionpaper.ca/features/2003/a_dream_only_american_power_can_inspire.html), a format [designed to be circumvent traditional distribution limitations](http://dominionpaper.ca/about/2003/layout_and_content.html), leveraging the net to get grass roots media off the net, and into communities. Very cool.

But where is the RSS feed?
