This weekend all seems so long ago I can barely remember it; afterall it was several hundred miles by car, and quite a few more on foot, a temperate rainforest, and several very nice beaches ago. However a few memories are still quite distinct.

In particular I remember Saturday afternoon leaving Jasmine happily chatting away with Ann, of the founders of [Z.A.P.P.](http://www.hugohouse.org/programs/zine.html), and making body art with [Christa Donner](http://artsymag.com/artists/mixed_media/donner.html) (both of whom have collaborated on [Artsy](http://artsymag.com)), while I, I with my unerring geek sense, managed to stumble into what had to be, must have been (please tell me was) the only **powerpoint presentation at Bumbershoot**. Felt just like being at a tech conferenceâ€¦.it was horrible.
