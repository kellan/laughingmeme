Apparently 50 countries, including Colombia(?!?), got their [military aid slashed](http://asia.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3020306 "Reuters | Latest Financial News / Full News Coverage") for refusing to acknowledge the US should be immune to the <acronym title="International Criminal Court">ICC</acronym> and above the law. (via [Anarchogeek](http://anarchogeek.com))

- Countries showing some backbone, and basic decency? (whatever their motivations)
- Defunds a piece of the drug war, which has succeeded only in destorying lives at home and abroad.
- If followed up by suspending Israelâ€™s military aid we might almost be able to make up for the Bush taxcuts (well not quite)

What interesting packages good news is coming in these days.
