One of the key topics (I think) in my \[Casual Privacy\](http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/1826) talk last week was the importance of “context” in privacy and sharing. That some people have trouble understanding how fundamental context is to all social interactions was my primary take away from \[SG Foo\](http://laughingmeme.org/2008/02/04/notes-from-social-graph-foo/), and I’ve been preaching it quietly where I can.

All by way of saying, I made one of my rare visits to \[FriendFeed\](http://friendfeed.com) this evening, and I was reminded that I consistently regret it. Breaking down those contextual walls means I consistently like the people I find there less then I did when I was able to interact with them in isolated manners; fire walling the aesthetic from the technical from the political from the personal.

We need routing not aggregation.
