In the style of the [London Underground map](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00005W&topic_id=1&topic=Ask%20E%2eT%2e), TBL has produced a [semantic web as subway map](http://cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=1032) graphic, which reminded me rather strongly of this pictorial representation of [RDF and XML](http://www.semaview.com/d/RDFandXML.jpg), aka the [“creepy, smiley and vaguely stunned-looking ideograms”](http://aaronland.info/weblog/archive/4871) graphic. (of course the fact that I had to email Aaron and ask him for that link implies that the web as perfect knowledge store does still need help of some kind).
