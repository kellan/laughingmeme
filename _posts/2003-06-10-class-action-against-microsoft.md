I have this image in my head of an “most wanted” poster with the word “Microsoft” emblazoned where the face should be, and beneath it, “Stop these people, before they code again!”.

Wired has an [analysis of the Slammer](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.07/slammer.html), the 376 byte UDP packet that brought down the Internet. The 376 byte UDP packet that brought down the Internet ***with Microsoft’s help!***

I thought they should be banned from releasing software after Outlook made the long time [Good Times virus hoax](http://www.stiller.com/gtimes.htm) a reality, but when their crap SQL server is destorying not only the internet but emergency services, and phone systems world wide it seems like its time to get tough. Wired mentions a $1billion figure as an estimate of the damage caused, that seems like a nice round figure to get us started, multiply that number a few times for the ongoing, chronic, and willful nature of the violations. Who knows, this could be [Corporate Death Penalty](http://monkeyfist.com/articles/340) material.
