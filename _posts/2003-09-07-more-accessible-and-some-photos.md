If you’ve been trying to get in touch with me, and I haven’t responded (of if I did respond and it made no sense), Jasmine flew home today, so I’m not nearly as distracted as I have been for the last 8-9 days. Still no net connection at the new house though.

Also my [first round of pictures](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/seattle_jasmine) from the last week is up. A few shots of [Bumbershoot](http://bumbershoot.org) and Seattle, but mostly of the Olympic Pennisula, and the Hoh rainforest. Of course the digital is just one of three cameras we were carrying, and this is just the selected shots from the first memory card, so more to come.
