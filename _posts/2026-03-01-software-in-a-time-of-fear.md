I enjoyed this essay from my friend Ed Lyons, which I think speaks well to _my_ particular state of mind as someone who has been in this industry for 30+ years, a parent, a people leader, a builder.

[Software, in a Time of Fear](https://mysteriousrook.medium.com/software-in-a-time-of-fear-4e5a08ac7c63)

> Up front, here are the lessons:
> 
> 1. Stop listening to people who are afraid
> 2. Seek first-hand testimony, not opinions
> 3. Go with someone much more enthusiastic than you
> 4. Do not look down
> 5. You must get different equipment
> 6. Put the summit out of your mind
> 
> Yet I hope you stay for the hike up.

Personally I'm working on 1, 2, 3, and 5. I'm struggling with 4 and 6.
