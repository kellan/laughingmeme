I gave a talk last October at the [First Round CTO Summit](http://firstround.com/article/How-Etsy-Grew-their-Number-of-Female-Engineers-by-500-in-One-Year) on what we’d learned at Etsy about hiring great engineers and in particular great women engineers for our team, and a little bit about the promising results we’d seen from the [Etsy + Hacker School program](https://www.etsy.com/hacker-grants).

The video went up last week, it’s 18 minutes long, it was given in a venue that was originally off the record and aimed at CTOs, and talks primarily about the work that [Marc](http://blog.precipice.org/) led. Folks seem to find it interesting, which is deeply gratifying.

This is the problem with giving talks on back to back days on different topics in Tokyo and San Francisco, you aren’t at your most polished.

The slides are [on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/kellan/more-women-in-engineering-something-that-actually-worked-14630106).
