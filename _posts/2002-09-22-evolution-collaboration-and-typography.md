At [Hampshire](http://www.hampshire.edu), the compsci ciriculum (in which I dabbled) was dominated by topics not normally turned over to undergrad students; artificial intelligence, complex system modelling, and especially evolutionary computing. (with a particular fierce focus on [genetic programming](http://www.genetic-programming.org/)) I think that is part of why this project [collaboratively evolve a typeface](http://typophile.com/cgibin/smaller.cgi) appeals to me so much. (though it uses humans as its sub systems instead of code, a very unorthodox approach)
