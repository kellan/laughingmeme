Its [Folklife](http://www.nwfolklife.org/) this weekend in Seattle, which means lots of good (and some bad), free/cheap music from across a huge spectrum.

I’ll definitely be seeing [Flying Folk Army](http://www.flyingfolk.ca/) from Vancouver, who’ll be playing Friday night, 8pm on the Broad St. Lawn stage. Rumor has it this might be their last visit to Evil Empire for a while, so see them while you can.

Also hoping to catch [Utah Phillips](http://www.utahphillips.org/) who is playing all weekend.
