[![](http://laughingmeme.org/img/IMG_1095_crop.jpg)](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/gasmask "My Wasting Lamps Some Fading Glimmer Left :: Urban Gas Masks")This stencil has been showing up recently in my neighborhood. Snapped [a few shots](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/gasmask "My Wasting Lamps Some Fading Glimmer Left :: Urban Gas Masks"), in keeping with Aaron’s [gas masks of Montreal](http://aaronland.info/weblog/2003/12/04/5326/) series. He is a better photographer alas.

I really wanted the “Very Cherry” boutique in the background to come out as well. Not sure what they sell, except that it has black, and red, and seems to fetishize consumption, and they blow cherry scent into the air in front of their store. The parallels are obvious.
