For all those threads, and mailing lists I’ve walked out on, for those comments left unanswered, and emails unreplied to. Sorry. I feel like hell. Sick as a dog, and an enflamed wisdom tooth. On the up side, apparently it warmed up enough to snow last night. Now I’m going to go crawl back into bed.
