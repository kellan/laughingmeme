The widely reported DDoS strike against Al Jazeera was disappointing but not entirely unexpected, as was the domain hijacking. What is more alarming is the a different kind of distributed denial of service attack; a business solution where technological ones “failed”.

The Register details this more insidious attack in [Al Jazeera and the Net – free speech, but don’t say that](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/30116.html).

- [Akami](http://www.akamai.com/index_noflash.html) just pulled out of dealing with them
- Before that their host [DataPipe](http://www.datapipe.com/) got cold feet
- [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com), whom the register likes to point out got in trouble for selling Nazi memorabilia, won’t even carry their ads

I’m waiting to see the Net routes around this.
