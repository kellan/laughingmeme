[Bloglines](http://bloglines.com) is another server-side aggregator, but unlike [Feed on Feeds](http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/), it is a service, not an application. It has a very simple interface, and a decent use of frames. It feels extremely fast, had a good registration process, and the validation email was handled well (which is what you would expect from the [founder of eGroups](http://www.bloglines.com/about/management)). It also has some advantages being a hosted service, able to poll once per feed, and thereby provide content very quickly when a person subscribes.

However I prefer to have more flexibility over when an item gets marked as read (currently items don’t have a concept of read/not read, only feeds), and it didn’t handle [my entry with a code sample](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000998.html#000998) very well at all.

Rumor has it that the Blogline crawler [sends the count of subscribers](http://www.wingedpig.com/) (note permalinks aren’t working) when it crawls. This hasn’t matched what I’ve observed, but maybe no one is reading LM with the service yet. (**update**: okay, now I seeming it, that is cool)

Currently the service is free, and ad-free. I think in the post dotcom era, where we’ve abandoned the baroque follies of the past, embraced quality of service, and the elegant [undesign](http://www.kottke.org/03/01/030126undesign.html), I would like to know a companies business model before I get to invested in it. Simple transparency, treat your customers as peers, and all that good stuff. And assure people that you aren’t going to flare, burn out, and disappear. Its not a universal rule, I think [Quicktopic](http://quicktopic.com) might have been the first dotcom I encountered that embraced the post-boom mentality and Steve Yost never fully explained the business model. But you got some hints. (**update:** [Steve M](http://minutillo.com/steve/weblog/) pointed me to [How much does it cost?](http://www.bloglines.com/help/faq#Cost) FAQ. )
