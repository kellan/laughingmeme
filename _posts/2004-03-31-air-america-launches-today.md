I have my doubts about how applicable the concept of “talk radio” is to the liberal project. Talk radio is a format whose primary job is to disseminate disinformation to the faithful, a high energy, high conflict entertaining inonculation against intelligent debate. I’m not sure how getting “our” own propaganda machine, to counteract the other guys propaganda machine does anything for democracy.

Still there are some smart people involved (Laura Flanders, Chuck D), and a whole bunch of smart people are excited about it, so I’m trying to reserve judgement. We’ve got it on in the background today, we’ll see.

(Ugh, its commercial radio, forgot about that.)

Tagline: Farther to the left then…
