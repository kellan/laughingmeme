Does anyone know if there is a way to limit your searches on Amazon to *only* items available for Amazon Prime?

(And to clarify I’m aggressive about buying books from local independents, but the ability to notice “Hey, we’re going to need a new toilet brush soon”, and have a nifty OXO designed one show up two days later is killer. Kind of like the mass transit version of driving out to a big box store [or so I like to delude myself])

**update:** [Lady Dr. Cutie TroublerMaker](http://proactivebusybody.com/) (pronouced “Abby”) points out an [AskMefi](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/30124) thread on exactly this topic.

The answer is “no” (or rather **“NO”**), but the suggested work around is to include the term “Amazon” in your searches.

I am also reminded that we have the [creative madman](http://www.kokogiak.com/) behind [Amazon Light ](http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon/)right here in Boston, and I should take this to him, so, um, [Alan](http://www.kokogiak.com/), any help?
