I didn’t do a very good job of advertising last week’s meetups, but just so you know, you missed the inaugural meeting of \[Boston.rb\](http://boston.rubygroup.org/) rising, phoenix-like, from the ashes. Next meeting is Oct. 4th (first Tuesday, also known as *Ruby Tuesday*), and I think I’m on the hook for some, as yet unspecified “tech talk”.

Also the first (only?) Web 2.0 meetup, which was a bit “schmoozy” for a term that I think of as capturing a back to our roots aspect of the Web, but was full of good people including \[Brian\](http://hybernaut.com/) (finally!), \[David\](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/), the other \[David\](http://genuinevc.com/), and \[Steve\](http://ampersand.com/blog/). \[Antonio\](http://theonda.org/) couldn’t make it, something about actually releasing software (so Web 1.0!), but he finally has a blog, so now I can link to him anyway.
