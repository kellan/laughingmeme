I’m heading out for a whirlwind tour of points ever so slightly south. I’ll be in San Diego for ETech, arriving Monday March 3rd (gulp, thats tomorrow) and leaving Thursday for Austin for SxSW, where I’ll be through next Tuesday night. (despite promises to myself, this is not the year I do the interactive+music marathon, I’m realistic, I’ve watched \[co-workers\](http://hitherto.net) train all year, not an undertaking for amateurs)

### ETech

I’m super excited by ETech this year for the first time in recent memory, all the things I want to talk about are on the schedule: large datasets, cheap customizable hardware, social networks, and the environmental, political, and social implications there of.

### SxSW

I haven’t even looked at the schedule for Austin yet, but I’m pumped to see both Heather and Simon talk about lessons learned from trying to internationalize a site like Flickr, (Mon 10am, and Tue 5pm respectively) and Paul and George (along with MattB, and SimonW) talk about working on interdisciplinary teams (Tue 3pm). And Andy’s ensemble “Worst Website Ever” stand up routine looks not to be missed.

### You

What are you going to see?

### Me

I’m also looking forward to:

- having some quiet time this week to work with Rabble and finally release the iCalico source, though it looks like I’m going to first learn git to do it
- making a little progress catching up on a serious backlog of writing.
- seeing friends, especially those who’ve recently been opting out of the grind of Silicon Valley jobs/San Francisco geek party scene.
- continue conversations I’ve been having with folks about privacy and social expectation, large datasets and inference, , open data, and of course OAuth.
