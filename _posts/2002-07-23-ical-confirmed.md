What a difference a weekend makes, and the difference is proof. (`/me hums along badly`)

[Apple reps say they are using iCalendar, and plan to be at the next CalConnect event](http://www.imc.org/ietf-calendar/mail-archive/msg06039.html)

[ectomort](http://www.ebyss.net/pages/resume.html) formerly of fusionOne says [“Apple’s got plenty of SyncML expirence despite the apparent silence”](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SyncML/message/953).

In response to [Jason’s excellent overview of the calsch world](http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$7900?mode=day), I want to say, that calling xCal (another name [with venerable history](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/xcal.html)) iCalendar version 3, might be over stating the case a bit. TimBL did do an intial XML/RDF profile of iCalendar, which was largely ignored, and rejected. Since then Frank Dawson, now working with the SyncML folks, has been trying to bring XML to a group that is very pre-Web, focused on BNF grammars, email, and custom protocols, not without a little friction. Notice that in the recently published [Guide to Internet Calendaring, June 2002](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3283.txt) there is one mention of XML, in the same sentence with the words: “non-standard”, and HTTP.

[AaronSW](http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$7902?mode=day): ” Hmph, TimBL and other W3Cers show them how to convert it to RDF/HTTP and they go and make it XML/BEEP.” **LOL**

Note: [CAP](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-calsch-cap-08.txt) isn’t really using XML, its using XML over [BEEP](http://www.beepcore.org/) as a transport layer for iCalendar blobs.
