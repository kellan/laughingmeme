My security culture is lousy, besides some basic self-censorship about what I talk about here on LM a quick Google search can find almost anything you wanted to know about me.

That said I find two websites have become an important part of my daily toolkit.

- [DodgeIt](http://www.dodgeit.com) – free, receive-only email. No set up. Check via the web or RSS
- [BugMeNot](http://bugmenot.com) – community maintained database of website logins, with a simple bookmarklet interface

And they work great together! Are there other tools people are using?
