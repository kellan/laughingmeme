Bah, too many projects, too little time. Until the day when I get back to this project, take a look at these other alternatives.

Someone else has built a nice, clean implementation of weather-over-RSS, see [rssWeather](http://rssweather.com). They are using [HAMWeather](http://www.hamweather.com/) as the backend, rather then a scraper, which is certainly a conceptual improvement, though it seems that HAMWeather is limited to using ICAO codes for non-US locations. (though that is probably scriptable around) Nicely browsable, good web integration.

I think I’ll probably revive my own [weather-rss](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001070.html) project at some point. (it moved forward a bit last weekend) In particular I still think there is an opportunity to format the weather info, in a more useful, and more semantic fashion. Once I’ve got my working example, I’ll probably be knocking on Tony of [OpenWeather’s](http://openweather.com) and [rssWeather.com’s](http://rssweather.com) door, see if we can get some coherence.
