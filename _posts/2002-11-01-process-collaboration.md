Kendall’s latest, [Community and Specifications](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/10/30/deviant.html) includes

> Megginson’s Four Laws of writing successful specs: 1. Simplicity succeeds
> 2. Process is poison
> 3. Code first, then specify
> 4. Almost every new spec fails anyway

(as the author of SAX presumably he knows of what he speaks) In a similar vein, the David Clark quote I had as my sig for years (and am thinking of reviving)

> “we reject kings, presidents and voting. we believe in rough consensus and running code.”

Been struggling with this of late, particularily in online organizing which exagerates communication problems; walking the line between enough process to stay transparent, and enough flexibility to stay open.
