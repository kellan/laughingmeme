Despite rumors to the contrary Seattle is a gorgeous, sunny, cosmopolitan city. This rain you hear about, a myth, to scare away us Californians. Both of my visits over the last two years have been accompanied by the best weather I would see all year (leaving out that brief jaunt to the beaches of Vieques).
