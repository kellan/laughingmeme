I’m online wirelessly from 1369 in Central Sq., a great community coffee shop, sometimes purveyor of [Rao’s](http://www.raoscoffee.com), and onetime site of my morning ritual consumption of lemon scone during the period when I was living in Central Sq. and working for Palm, and mornings needed more justification.. Add it to the list of good independent coffee shops with free wireless.
