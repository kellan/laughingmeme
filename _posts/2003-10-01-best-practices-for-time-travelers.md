Maciej lays out [some basic dos and donâ€™ts](http://www.idlewords.com/weblog.09.2003.html#293 "Idle Words") for announcing to the Net you are a traveler from the future. Begins with an indepth look at John Titor, as a successful model.

Well worth the read, and very informative. Does call into question that [sudden appearance of prior LSI art](http://www.idlewords.com/weblog.05.2003.html#192) though.
