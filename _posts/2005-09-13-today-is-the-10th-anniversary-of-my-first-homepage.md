Turned in as an assignment for Rich Muller’s \[“Networks, Computers, and Stories”\](http://alum.hampshire.edu/~mnbF94/CCS112p.html). The class was supposed to be on hypertext fiction but a strong geek contingent in the room spent our time fiddling with cgi-lib.pl, imagemagick, and building galleries of background patterns. (\[Seth Mills-Cannon’s\](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22seth%20mills-cannon%22) I think was definitive of the genre, even today)

In fact, I’m not sure I ever got to the story piece, but the homepage did have randomly rotating graphic sets, random fortune quotes, and the current time (using non-parsed header animated graphics of course). Much more advanced then this current page of mine.

Thankfully it was lost to history.
