The writing was on the wall.

> Jack Dorsey: Taking the subway to Union Sq. The NYC one. ([July 23rd](http://twitter.com/jack/statuses/164331062))

(actually I missed that one, but Twitters from Jack regarding the White Stripes were a dead give away!)

Bit late, but congrats to both Twitter and WeSabe on closing funding with [Union Sq. Ventures](http://www.unionsquareventures.com/).

Like Tony said, [“All my friends go with Union Sq.”](http://www.stubbleblog.com/archives/2007/07/all*my*friends.html). I’ve been fan (a fan of a VC!?!?) since shortly before their del.icio.us investment, and they continue to fund my favorite start ups.

We walked by their office today, but too busy to stop in and say, “Hi”.
