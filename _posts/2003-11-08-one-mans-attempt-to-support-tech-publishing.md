Eric collects [multiple data points](http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2003_11_01_index.html#106774201958133703), including Kendall’s [XML Book Business](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/29/deviant.html) indicating that the tech book business is not doing well. Of course I’ve always thrown off the curve when it comes to buying books (and not just tech books), but I noticed that I am buying a different style of book these days.

My 3 most recent tech book purchases have been 2 books from O’Reilly’s [“Hacks”](http://hacks.oreilly.com/) series, [Linux Server Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxsvrhack/) (which is excellent!), and [Spidering Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/) (which hasn’t arrived yet, but whose ToC overcame both my doubts about the authors, and a feeling that it would be too junior), and [Manning’s](http://manning.com) [Eclipse in Action](http://www.manning.com/gallardo/index.html) (from their new “In Action” series).

No 800+ page reference books here. (and no XML books) The Hacks books are short, relevant, and fun. They build on the what I consider to be the best O’Reilly book ever, the [Perl Cookbook](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlckbk2/), but corrected for the accelerated, networked world we live in. <cite>Eclipse in Action</cite> similarly eschews the reference book approach and plays to Manning’s traditional strengths, blending theory, and best practices effortlessly with the more traditional material (as seen in the excellent [Object Oriented Perl](http://www.manning.com/Conway/index.html), and [Web Development with JSP](http://www.manning.com/fields2/)). EiA doesn’t just cover how to use Eclipse, but assumes you’re wanting to use it in an agile development environment with CVS, [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/), [JUnit](http://www.junit.org), and optionally [Tomcat](http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html) and [log4j](http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html). Talk about getting it right!

No lofty conculsions, but wanted to add a data point to the mix. Though as I sit with it, I think that I’m using the web to find both the traditional reference style info O’Reilly used to be famous for, and the thought provoking theory books in the [Addison-Wesley](http://www.aw-bc.com/home) style (which has largely been replaced by blogs like [Ted](http://sauria.com/blog) and [Dan](http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/), [CiteSeer](http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs), and [Artima](http://www.artima.com), and were always the hardest to justify spending the money on)
