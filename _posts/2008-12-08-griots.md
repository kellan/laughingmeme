> *A griot (pronounced /g?i.??/ in English or \[??i.o\] in French, with a silent t) or jeli (djeli or djéli in French spelling) is a West African poet, praise singer, and wandering musician, considered a repository of oral tradition.* – [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griot)

Also an emerging tag for describing the ongoing \[protest in Athens\](http://www.indymedia.org/en/2008/12/917365.shtml) over a 16 year old being shot to death at point blank range by Athens policemen.

Being used on \[Flickr\](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/griots), \[blogs\](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=griots&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;scoring=d), and \[Twitter\](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=griots) and the meta \[del.icio.us\](http://delicious.com/tag/griots). Not being used by the \[corporate media\](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=griots&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;scoring=n) (aside: the trailing ‘s’ is lexically significant, classic stemming does not work on tags)

Does anyone know how and where this tag emerged?

Clearly the next evolution in participatory media (and the only type with a future) is figuring out what the tools to discover, distribute and broadcast these meta-media collaborative objects. Who is thinking and writing about this?
