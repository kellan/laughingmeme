So, I’ve got 500 referers and counting, today, alone, for the search term “makes baby jesus cry”.

Can someone explain this to me?

**update:** so google thinks I’m the definitive word on making baby jesus cry. and [arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com) recently suggested to its readers that they check with google about such things. which explains where those 1200 referers came from, and incidentally the much larger precentage of windows users in my readership these last few days.
