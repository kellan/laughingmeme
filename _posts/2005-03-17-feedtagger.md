One of the keys to any decent social software project is making it useful enough to the individual that they generate the data that makes the network useful. [FeedTagger](http://www.feedtagger.com/) seems poised to do this.

The idea is simple. [FeedTagger](http://www.feedtagger.com/) is a web based aggregator that allows you to browse not only by feeds and folders like existing aggregators but also by tags, tags you assign on a per feed, or per item basis.

Right now the emergent social knowledge community is just a flicker of potential, but in the mean time its a very interesting re-thinking of the aggregator.

And [Chris](http://tahpot.blogspot.com/) is blogging about his experience building it, including using [Magpie](http://magpierss.sf.net) to run [smack into PHP5â€™s XML parsing bugs](http://tahpot.blogspot.com/2005/03/feedtaggercom-php5.html). (fixed in the [PHP5 nightlies](http://snaps.php.net/))
