Several years ago I started talking about “personal brand management”. Came out of my talks with a number of people, primarily of course [my lovely branding consultant fiancee](http://brandxculture.com/), but also folks like [MattB](http://hackdiary.com/) who was just beginning his nomadic hacking excursion. The idea of managing your personal brand seems awful important (I wouldn’t know for 100% sure as I don’t do a very good job), but I’ve never quite liked the phrase.

Which is why I was happy to find the term “identity work” in this article about [parents failing to convince their children to use Twitter](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/14/fashion/14Cyber.html).

As in:

> “The people who I see using it are an older demographic, […] who use it for work, [or] to present themselves as particular types of people. Theyâ€™re using it to do identity work.”

So much more soothing, and hip sounding.
