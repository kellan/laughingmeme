Itâ€™s official, Iâ€™m going to Seattle to join [ActionStudio](http://www.actionstudio.org)/[Groundspring](http://groundspring.org) of [Tides Foundation](http://www.tidesfoundation.org/) as a Software Engineer (and open source advocate). Groundspring is developing hosted open source tools to help non-profits utilize the web more effectively. At least, that what they tell me ðŸ˜‰

So thank you to everyone who listened to the hair pulling, teeth gnashing, angsty decision making process, sorry about that.

And finally there is something La Manchian about the work, a trait it shares with anti-globalization activism, after all what could be more quixotic in 2003 then to be learning Cold Fusion?
