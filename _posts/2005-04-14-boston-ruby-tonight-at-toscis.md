You’re still welcome to come even if you haven’t RSVP’ed yet. Here is a note I sent out to the [Boston Ruby meetup](http://ruby.meetup.com/58/) list

> Hi all, So we’re on for meeting up this Thursday at [Toscanini’s in Central Sq. at 7pm.][1] I’ve received several out of band RSVPs so currently I’m expecting 4-5 people (but it may be just me and irb.rb for company).
