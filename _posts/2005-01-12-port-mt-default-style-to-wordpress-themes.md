Is there a reason no one has ported the the Moveable type default styles ([2.6](http://www.movabletype.org/help/default_styles_26.shtml), and [3.0](http://www.movabletype.org/default_styles.shtml)) to WordPress themes? There are the extreme themes like [Kubrick](http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick), but very few solid, light weight, attractive options to get up and running fast with a new [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blog. (that I’ve found)

If I wanted to launch a couple of low energy side project blogs I’d be tempted to go with Moveable Type, just because I could be guarenteed to get an attractive if generic look in minutes. (In particular, I’d like [Plain Jane](http://www.movabletype.org/help/default_styles_26.shtml#plainjane))
