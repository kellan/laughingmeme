    - "Last week I was asked who was doing design I liked (being famously grouchy about other people\\'s design) and came up short, not because there isn\\'t good design out there, but because I hadn\\'t been looking for it recently.  The next day, [Seth](http://mojodna.net/) and I dug up a few well designed blogs, and I noticed they all shared an interesting characterisitic, they all exhibited symptoms of having recently contracted the \\\"Musical Baton\\\" meme.  Given the social nature of this meme, it was easier to track then the famous [p23s5](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001960.html) meme, and I\\'ve only taken the time to make a simple infection map for this community.  Additionally unlike p23s5 the meme itself is less interesting in its expression, but instead serves as a marker for a given community of suspectible individuals.\n\n\nJon Hicks proved to be a key infectious individual, one of the earliest to exhibit signs of this mutated strain of \\\"Musical Baton\\\" that seems to only pass between web designers (he was exposed to the original strain by [Richard](http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1457/))\n\n1. **[Jon Hicks - hicksdesign](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/a-musical-baton)**\n    \n    Of course, why didn\\'t I think of Hicks?

Last week I was asked who was doing design I liked (being famously grouchy about other people’s design) and came up short, not because there isn’t good design out there, but because I hadn’t been looking for it recently. The next day, [Seth](http://mojodna.net/) and I dug up a few well designed blogs, and I noticed they all shared an interesting characterisitic, they all exhibited symptoms of having recently contracted the “Musical Baton” meme. Given the social nature of this meme, it was easier to track then the famous [p23s5](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001960.html) meme, and I’ve only taken the time to make a simple infection map for this community. Additionally unlike p23s5 the meme itself is less interesting in its expression, but instead serves as a marker for a given community of suspectible individuals.

Jon Hicks proved to be a key infectious individual, one of the earliest to exhibit signs of this mutated strain of “Musical Baton” that seems to only pass between web designers (he was exposed to the original strain by [Richard](http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1457/))
