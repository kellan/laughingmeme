Seattle is a city, if such a thing is possible, with too many Thai restaurants. Many of them excellent. So when I say that Thai Thom is amazing, and stands out from the crowd, understand what I’m telling you. The food is phenomenal in a simple, street stall kind of way, and sitting at the counter watching the cooking is fascinating, and exhilarating, sharp knives, dancing flames, sauces and fresh ingredients flash almost faster then the eye can follow, feet and sometimes inches from where you sit.

Its a little whole in the wall which I’ve walked by literally dozens of time without ever noticing, right on [the Ave](http://maps.yahoo.com//maps_result?csz=Seattle%2C+WA+98105-4510&state=WA&uzip=98105), half a block up from 45th.

Be prepared to wait.
