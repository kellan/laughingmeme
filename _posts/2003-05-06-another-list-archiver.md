Mailing lists play a role probably unhealthly large in my daily life, work, and organizing, so I’m inordinately interested in list archivers. My favorite current setup is one we use for [TechFed](http://notes.techfed.net) where everything gets piped to a news server, and from there to a web discussion forum, but if you’re going to go with a pure mail archiving solution, the simple aesthetics and intuitiveness of a Mailman archive can’t be beat. Unforunately the MIME handling, searching, post removal, and general list maintence of Mailman’s pipermail based solution is, ummm, less ideal. So the search continues.

[Archive](http://www.clearsilver.net/archive/) is new entrant into the a field which will crowded can always use a little more competition. Their interface looks like a blend of [Sympa](http://listes.cru.fr/wws/arc/sympa-users), [Google News](http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&threadm=a3b5b608.0304040904.146dfff5%40posting.google.com&rnum=69&prev=/&frame=on). in equal portions. Written in Python, and used by the Mono, and OSAF groups I assume its open source, but find no way to download it.
