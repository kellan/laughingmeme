Sorry to be so quiet. It is an amazingly huge country. I never want to see the inside of a car again. On the third or fourth hour crossing Wynoming (or maybe Kansas) I decided we had a taken a wrong turn somewhere, Boston had to be closer then this, we had gone left instead of right at Interstellar-34, and this was now the Moon, or Tau Ceti, or something. More soonâ€¦.
