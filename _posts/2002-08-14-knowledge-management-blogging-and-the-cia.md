Knowledge managment and blogging has always gone hand in hand, especially before personal publishing was a legitimate buzzword, and there briefly flourished (and died, I hope) the term “k-log”.

[Jon Udell](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/) recently had [nice things to say](http://www.infoworld.com/articles/ap/xml/02/07/15/020715aptraction.xml) about the Traction Software’s knowledge management solution, *“best described as an enterprise Weblog system”*.

He failed to mention, its [funded by the CIA](http://www.bennett.com/archives/001011.html#001011).

And here I thought the $5000 price tag was the only problem.
