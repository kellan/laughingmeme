Quarter sized, paper thin translucent jellies with half-circle\nsails, now in a thick dried out line along the beach like so much disposed\nsaran wrap. (or codoms) And big piles of kelp from the bottom of the bay,\nand 2 giant jellyfish, 14 inches across, and the waves were a blue-green\nwith the sun shining through them, like the bits of glass of you find\ntossed up on the sand."

Iâ€™m back at my parents house for the week, while I try to figure out what happens next. After 6 months in the fog of San Francisco, it is glorious in Santa Cruz. We must have had a storm last night, as millions of man-o-wars have washed up on Seacliffe beach. Quarter sized, paper thin translucent jellies with half-circle sails, now in a thick dried out line along the beach like so much disposed saran wrap. (or codoms) And big piles of kelp from the bottom of the bay, and 2 giant jellyfish, 14 inches across, and the waves were a blue-green with the sun shining through them, like the bits of glass of you find tossed up on the sand.
