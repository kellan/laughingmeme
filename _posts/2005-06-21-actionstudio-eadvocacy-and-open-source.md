One of the many things to come from [Jeff](http://idealog.us), [Todd](http://constellations.omniversemusic.com/) and myself leaving [Groundspring](http://groundspring.org) was an option to release the the GS [suite of tools](http://www.groundspring.org/services/index.cfm) as open source. This has been a slow process, and most of this code was never developed to be open source, but over time weâ€™ll be packaging piece of it up (in the mean time [Tactical Tech](http://www.tacticaltech.org/) and [CiviCRM](http://www.socialsourcefoundation.org/html/civicrm.html) are looking into using).

There is a [Sourceforge project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/eadvocacy), an [nearly empty wiki](http://open.actionstudio.org/), and [a mailing list](http://open.actionstudio.org/index.php/Main\_Page#Lists). (what else could possibly been needed for a successful open source project!)

In the mean time, one of the exciting possibilities that releasing the code made possible is that Jeff has been able to resurrect the discontinued [AdvocacyNow](http://www.actionstudio.org/) tool at the original [ActionStudio.org](http://www.actionstudio.org/) domain.
