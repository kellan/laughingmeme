![](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/albums/orcas04/IMG_1425.highlight.jpg)Orcas have been one of my favorite creatures for a long long time. So it was immensely fun to go on a “whale watching” trip with my parents, leaving out of Orcas Island.  
In August you only have a 65% chance of seeing orcas in the waters around San Juan, but K and L pod are more consistently in the waters joining the year around resident J pod. We got lucky. We saw J, K, and L, all swimming together. There are currently 83 individuals among those 3 pods (a shockingly low number to be living in the San Juans), and while there weren’t 83 orcas in the water, there were several dozen.

At first we parked the boat so far away you could [barely see the fins](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/orcas04/IMG_1419) in the distance, but we positioned ourselves luckily enough that the [oracs swam towards us](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/orcas04/IMG_1425), and eventually [2 teenagers dove under our boat](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/orcas04/IMG_1426), breeching immediately on the other side, 3 feet from where I was standing. This was of course when my camera decided to turn off. (I’m still frustrated, 2 days later)

Slightly less amazing was the [clutter of other whale watching trips](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/orcas04/IMG_1429). You can’t help but wonder if it has some sort of detrimental effect on the pods to be constantly surrounded by boats. In general the orcas didn’t seem to mind, and were clearly playing in and around the boats, often [breeching](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/orcas04/IMG_1435) directly in front of the boats.
