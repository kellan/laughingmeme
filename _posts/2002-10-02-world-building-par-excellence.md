Tolkien invented his world so as to have a sufficiently complex backdrop with which to play with linguistic theory. My brother has been running a similar project, “playing games with reality’s rules”, over at [Sedes Draconis](http://www.sedesdraconis.com), a multi-civilization, biologically complex thought space. Most recently his [Gnomish Culture Test](http://www.sedesdraconis.com/index.cgi?Gnome/Test) was accepted to the pantheon of [culture tests](http://www.zompist.com/amercult.html) maintained by Zompist.

### Whats a culture test?

You can think of culture tests as being similar to those “Which X are you?” tests (e.g. [“Which revolution are you?”](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000146.html#000146)) but better thought out, and without the cute banner that you can hang on your website. [Zompist](http://zompist.com) wrote the first one in response to the claim, “There is no American culture”, and it took off from there. Are you [American](http://www.zompist.com/amercult.html), [Canadian](http://www.zompist.com/canada.html), [Dutch](http://www.zompist.com/dutchcult.html), or [Verdurian](http://www.zompist.com/vercult.html)? ### Culturally Biased Conceptions of Terrain

I’ve also been meaning to blog Aidan’s [critique of Civilization’s terrain model](http://www.sedesdraconis.com/index.cgi?Unrelated/Civ). Civ is one of the most amazing computer games ever, and Civ III improved many of its basic assumptions, providing for more realism and flexibility. However it has a few ideas which they haven’t gone back to re-examine over the years. Like the very common Grassland terrain.  
> *I think what is meant by Grassland is the kind of well-watered, productive terrain common in the American East, and Europe. But. Such terrain is not naturally occurring.*

Lots more good stuff, on grasslands, irrigation, rainfall, and the surprising scarcity of iron. If you’ve ever played Civ, and even if you haven’t, interesting stuff.
