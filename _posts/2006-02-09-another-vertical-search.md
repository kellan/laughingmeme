I’m sure if I could ever get [Zillow](http://zillow.com) to load it could be interesting, and for many out there I’m sure [HealthLine](http://www.healthline.com/) is useful, but would someone hurry up and launch a vertical search that allows me to find hotel rooms with fireplaces or better yet cabins with woodstoves?
