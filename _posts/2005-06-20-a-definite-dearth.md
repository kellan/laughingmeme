Spent lunch chatting about all things Web 2.0, and found someone else who is asking the same question I’ve been asking

> Where are the cool East Coast start ups?

Where are the [Robot Coops](http://robotcoop.com/), the [Flickrs](http://flickr.com), the [Odeos](http://odeo.com)? I’d settle for a [24 Hour Laundry](http://www.24hourlaundry.com/). Its like something happens somewhere around Chicago, that means the East Coast is going to miss Web 2.0 even worse then it missed Web 1.0
