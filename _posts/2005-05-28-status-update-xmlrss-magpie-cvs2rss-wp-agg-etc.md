Dan from \[GeekUprising\](http://geekuprising.com/) is now the official maintainer of \[XML::RSS\](http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS). I imagine his first major change will be to incorporate the patch he sent me last Fall splitting the RSS creation logic from the RSS parsing logic (while still being transparent to people who don’t want that kind of thing). Congratulations, and welcome.

\[cvs2rss\](http://laughingmeme.org/cvs2rss/) has been missing since the last server move, but well placed nudge from \[Phil\](http://ultimate.com) got me to dig up the archives today, so \[voila\](http://laughingmeme.org/cvs2rss/), as they.

My aggregator for \[Wordpress\](http://wordpress.org), affectionately known as \[wp-agg\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002203.html) is officially superseded by \[FeedWordPress\](http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/). Charles has done a great job growing the idea to something useful to someone other then me, and polished it off by actively maintaining it. Nice work. I’ll be switching the \[Magpie blog\](http://magpie.laughingmeme.org/blog/) as soon as I get a chance.

\[Sourceforge stats\](http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group*id=55691&amp;ugn=magpierss) after a 6 month hiatus (or was it 18 months? now I’m forgetting), are finally back, now with \[largely useless graphs\](http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group*id=55691&amp;ugn=magpierss). I had a hunch that usage had continued to grow and it has, with 5,000 page views a day, and 6,000 downloads a month. Wow. Really need to revive the website to handle the enlarged community.

You know, now that I’m a contractor again, if someone wanted to hire me for 20-25 hours of work I’ve got a list of features that I’d love to have time to roll out as \[MagpieRSS\](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) version 0.8.
