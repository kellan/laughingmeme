And the quote of the week

> Who would have guessed that the Republican October surprise would be Reagan dying? I wonder how long they’ve had him on ice? – [Jeff](http://idealog.us)

A useful summary of [Ronald Reagan](http://www.infoshop.org/university/reagan.php), ideal for future generations of Googlers.
