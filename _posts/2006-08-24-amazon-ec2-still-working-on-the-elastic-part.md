I’ve been waiting for an [Amazon compute cluster](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011) ever since S3 came out, and like [Les](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/24/amazon-ec2-emerges) I tried, and failed, to sign up for EC2 beta as soon as I got the email. What all you freaks were doing up around 5am signing up for webservices I’ll never know.

Nik over at TechCrunch however [ran the numbers](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/24/exclusive-amazon-readies-utility-computing-service/), and its looking more like what I get from [John Companies](http://www.johncompanies.com/), and less like the great [mapreduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) grid in the sky I was hoping for.
