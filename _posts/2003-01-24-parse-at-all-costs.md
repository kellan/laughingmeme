I wrote [Magpie](http://magpierss.sf.net) to put an end to the legions of PHP “RSS Parsers” that were using regular expressions. Martin put the regular expressions back in by writing a [alternate backend](http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/magpie/magpie_alike.php) using the [REX](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/REX.html) api. Now the regex based [parse at all cost](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/01/22/dive-into-xml.html) (recently rebranded from ultra-liberal*) strategy is back. As Eric said recently, “The universe has a very dry sense of humor.”*

( Kendall, couldn’t we have renamed it to neo-liberal if we were dropping the ultra-liberal moniker?)
