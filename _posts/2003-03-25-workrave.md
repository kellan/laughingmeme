I just started using [Workrave](http://workrave.sourceforge.net) this weekend after it was featured in NTK’s [sufficiently advanced technology](http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-03-21&l=84#l). Its a niffty little RSI prevention tool that watches your activity and suggests micropauses, coffee breaks (it does not monitor caffeine levels), and when you’ve been in front of the computer long enough and its time to go for a bike ride. Very nicely done. Needs a Window Maker applet though. Would be nice if it could also tell you, “You’ve spinning your wheels staring at that bug for 2 hours, do something else!”. Maybe in version 2?

ps. if someone wants to buy me an iBook I’ll port it to OS X.
