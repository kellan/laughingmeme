> Do you ever think maybe the Apple guys are just winding you up? Nobody could possibly be *that* stupid.

Maybe, though I tend to share [Phil’s](http://weblog.philringnalda.com/) skepticism. Lets start the with the name, “photocasting”. Worst name I’ve heard since “MacBook”. I’d speculate that Apple’s marketing department recently started outsourcing to Engineering, except I’d be slandering my own profession. That’s a minor thing, aesthetic really, but dear god, how could they screw up the RSS? Again? (especially as I *know* people at Apple who are not only smart and clueful, but get XML)

I mean the iTunes name space was a [*train wreck*](http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/06/28-rss-apple-itunes/read). (though truth be told podcasting for some reason produces the scariest, wackiest feeds on the planet, at one point roughly 1/3 of the feeds [Odeo](http://odeo.com) was crawling had serious errors)

User agent detection? Of RSS? **In 2006?!?** Come again?

Embedded CSS? Misformatted dates? Random, namespace-less new elements (PhotoDate?) A new standard for including comments within an item.

See [Phil’s comment](http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3247), [Sam](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/01/11/Photocasting), [Dave Winer](http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/11/welcome-to-the-wonderful-wacky-world-of-apple-rss/)

Hey [Apple](http://apple.com), consider hiring someone who knows something about syndication, it’s worth it.

Take [a look](http://photocast.mac.com/mrakes/iPhoto/photocast\_test/index.rss) (unless of course you’re using Firefox).

**update:** [2005/01/18] [MarkP on “photocasting”][markp]. It’s not just bad, it’s spectaculary bad. ([via][tbray])
