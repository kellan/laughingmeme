I think that MT-Blacklist (and the various other blacklist implementations) should share 2 lists. The first list is the current lists we’re all sharing, a list of domain names that cause a comment to be flagged as spam.

The second list would be a list of carefully qualified domains of repeat offenders. This list would be a list of domains to request files from repeatedly as [suggested on /. recently](http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=77014&threshold=-1&commentsort=3&tid=111&mode=thread&cid=6855944), a distributed “stress test” if you will.
