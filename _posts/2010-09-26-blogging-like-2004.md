Forgive me, this is a purely self indulgent post written mostly for some future me.

Dan has a post on \[blogging like it’s 2004\](http://revdancatt.com/2010/09/25/blogging-like-its-2004/). I quickly skimmed back over the archives to see what blogging like 2004 would mean for me. Short answer, “A lot of link blogging!” or MLPs as I was calling them back then as a hat tip to \[Kuro5hin\](http://www.kuro5hin.org/). For most of 2004 I was living in Seattle, working for the \[Tides\](http://tides.org) foundation on Groundspring, and spending evens and weekend hacking with \[Riseup\](http://riseup.net), and really developing my coffee addiction in that city’s legendary coffee shops.

Pulled a few of my favorite posts, mixed in a few that still get daily traffic after half a decade plus.

\[page 23, sentence 5: an autopsy\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/04/18/page-23-sentence-5-an-autopsy/) – online epidemiography and books.

\[SF vs NYC\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/04/06/sf-vs-nyc/) – my first SF vs NYC post

\[Semi-Intelligent String Cropping with PHP\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/05/25/semi-intelligent-string-cropping-with-php/) – this post gets views everyday, sometimes up to a 100.

\[Cascading Prerequisites\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/06/27/cascading-prerequisites/) – I was complaining about CPAN preqs this weekend, apparently I’ve been doing that for 6 years.

\[WordPress RSS Aggregator\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/07/18/wordpress-rss-aggregator/) – another perennial traffic sink.

\[Special Treatment\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/07/10/special-treatment/) – I no longer get flagged for security treatment every time I fly, but I still was in 2004.

\[Not Free Enough Anymore\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/05/15/not-free-enough-anymore/), \[Hosted Web Apps\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/07/06/hosted-web-apps/) – on stopping using Moveable Type, and canceling my Typepad account. 6A held on for another 6 years, until \[last week\](http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2010/09/introducing-say-media-good-new.html)

\[MySQL, and the CASE for Class Table Inheritance\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/08/14/mysql-and-the-case-for-class-table-inheritance/) – perennially popular, I’ve considered putting up a note saying “Excess Cleverness Considereded Harmful” on the page.

\[Thats Why I Still Have a 415 #\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/09/22/thats-why-i-still-have-a-415/) – I still have a 415, the same 415.

\[Notes on working remotely\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/09/20/notes-on-working-remotely/) – insight from my friend Carl, who now works remotely in Singapore. I refer back to these regularly.

\[Money, Services, and the Changing Nature of Information Consumption\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/09/20/money-services-and-the-changing-nature-of-information-consumption/) – thinking about the tension of community funded services, something I still spend most of my time doing.

\[WordPress, Tagging, and a Critique of Hierarchy\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/09/05/wordpress-tagging-and-a-critique-of-hierarchy/) – tagging!

\[Now With Extra Top Spin\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/09/29/now-with-extra-top-spin/) – vote with rocks, 2004 was an election year, someone should still make this shirt, does MTV even still run Rock the Vote?

\[In Print\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/10/06/in-print/) – Magpie featured in one of the early Apress books.

\[TextMate 1.0\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/10/05/textmate-10/) – and still no 2.0 yet.

\[apt-get install anarchism\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/11/03/apt-get-install-anarchism/) – we got shirts printed up for our Cascadia Anarchist Tech Skillshare. When I dropped in to \[Debconf\](http://debconf10.debconf.org/) this year, people were still wearing them, and printing new ones.

\[Moving (back) to Boston\](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/11/23/moving-back-to-boston/) – Seattle =&gt; Boston
