The [“You and X”](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577\_3-20021068-36.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=TheSocial) pages are my favorite Facebook feature I’ve seen in a long time. (I’ll admit I’m a pretty limited user of “the Book” so the bar is low, though a new feature we launched adminonly yesterday on Etsy is making me think about bulking up on ‘Book friends).

Also reminded me of my favorite semi-secret feature of [Flickr people tagging](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2009/10/21/people-in-photos/): the “You + X” pages.

If you visit the [“/photosof/kellan”](http://flickr.com/photosof/kellan) style people URLs you’ll get prompted “Anyone ever snapped a picture of the two of you?” and if you click on the link you can see pictures of the two of you. (us?) You can also hack the URL to string together a [longer list of folks](http://www.flickr.com/photosof/murphy\_slaw+hitherto+brevity+ashot+dunstan+shanan+bees+joemud+judemat+allspaw+heydrienne+revdancatt+rossharmes+mannyv+kakul+avatara+andthemonkey+kellan+mylesdgrant+ahmany).
