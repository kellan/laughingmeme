[OSCal](http://oscal.quxx.info/) needs a name.

I never liked OSCal, but I couldn’t argue with the late night logic of “OScal – the OSCON Calendar” on the grounds of simplicity. And I might be talked into “OSCal – the [EuroOSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/) calendar”, but we all draw the line at “OSCal – the [RailsConf Europe](http://europe.railsconf.org/) calendar”.

Plus we’ll be open sourcing it as soon as [Rabble](http://anarchogeek.com) or I get a free moment, at which point the name gets really silly.

So, um, help? **Good names needed.** (not to mention short domains)

### Rhymes with Orange?

Concepts I’ve been playing with: conference, event, calendar, social, schedule, discovery, interests, open, network, mob, triage, simple.

### ONU – OSCal is Not Unix?

Best I came up with was “decafe” for “decentralized calendar for events”, which had potential except nobody likes decafe (and [decafbad.com](http://decafbad.com) was already taken).

Not that I suggest you limit your creativity to the rather unfortunate geek tendency towards acronyms, short, pronounceable, and easy to understand when read over a loud speaker at the front of a echoing conference hall.

We need you, you’re our only hope.
