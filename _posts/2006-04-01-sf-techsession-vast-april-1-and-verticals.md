[SF Techsession 2: Communities and Interaction](http://sftechsessions.com/2006/03/community-interaction/) was a **vast** improvement over the previous one. Better presenters, better products, better questions, better venue, better food, better open bar.

I confess that I was mildly disturbed that I was able to make it two instances of a monthly even in SF given that I love 3000 miles away, but I can’t imagine there is a third topic as close to my heart as community or calendaring.

### Vast on April 1st

Apropos, one of the participant, Vast, the “vertical search platform” has the only funny April Fool’s gag I’ve seen. (I’m not a fan of the holiday) They announced their [Credit Cards](http://www.vast.com/v.php?v=home) vertical search today, and its a nicely done implementation. (Vast’s trademark low budget web design adds credibility to the whole gag)

[Vast](http://vast.com) is making noise by “giving it all away”, they’re catchy “Steal this Site” link at the bottom of each page captures the imagination. Except they aren’t giving me the **one** thing that would be most valuable for both of us. I want to build vertical of data I care about, and Vast wants to learn about new segments, talk about an [architecture of participation](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture*of*participation.html) waiting to happen.

My take away was an idea with the same sense of inevitability that [Epinions](http://epinions.com) had, and I worried about similar deep conceptual flaws.

### Home Rolled Verticals and Blogs

Speaking of which why aren’t any of the blog search engines distinguishing themselves by providing a search platform ala [Amazon’s Alexa Web Information Service](http://pages.alexa.com/prod\_serv/WebInfoService.html)? While its relatively challenging to figure out how do something cool with Alexa’s raw index (hence the need for DIY interface to Vast), *everybody* seems to have a story about what they would do if could convincing crawl the blog/conversation space.

### The Others

[Skobee](http://skobee.com) is a slick and simple as it seems, built by ex-PlumTree’ers (the folks who also built [O’Reilly’s Connection](http://connection.oreilly.com/). Also presenting [Songbird](http://www.songbirdnest.com/), and [Mozes](http://mozes.com)
