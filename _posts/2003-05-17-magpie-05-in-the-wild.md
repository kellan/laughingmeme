Its been 4 days since the [release of MagpieRSS 0.5](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000742.html#000742). I admit it wasnâ€™t a very exciting new feature. Still, I had hoped that somebody might use it; figured I might see it being used to download one of the dozens of RSS feeds I maintain. No such luck, just 0.3 as far as the eye can see.
