Guardian has a good article on [Blair’s failed policy to influence Bush](http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,778296,00.html) by supporting the war on terror.

Choice quotes:

> *The prime minister’s evident faith that he could turn Bush green if only for the duration of a single South African photo opportunity seems all the more naive because the very idea conflicts with the president’s two deepest political principles: - Do what your biggest campaign contributors tell you to do.
> - Don’t do what your daddy did when he was president .*

and > *The British rationale for the blank-cheque support offered to US foreign and security policy relies heavily on the “change-from-within” argument – employed by many an erstwhile student radical on taking up a lucrative job in the City.*

Because sometimes you forget just how bad he is.
