It’s that time again. Shocking as it maybe I’ve been in Seattle for 6 months now, and my short term lease, which seemed like it would last into the unimaginably distant future is up at the end of February. (perhaps even more shockingly for those who know me, I’m not looking to move to a new city quite yet)
