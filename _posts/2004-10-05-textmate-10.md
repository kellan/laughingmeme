[TextMate 1.0](http://macromates.com/), billed as “the missing editor for OS X” is out. I’ve always been graphical text editor person myself (with the occasional slide into jed when a gui isn’t an option), and while I’ve been using BBedit off and on for nearly a decade (and am currently using BBedit 8.0.2) I can’t say I’ve ever been entirely happy with it. I’ll be evaluating this over the next few days.

In other news is [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://www.loudthinking.com/) the most productive programmer around? Or just a compelling evangelist? Or both!?!

(p.s. I feel I should add that BBedit’s new drawer feature, and the option to have the bbedit cli open documents in the drawer has been making me very happy of late)
