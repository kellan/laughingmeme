Quinn posted a description of her dream conference, [the o’reilly technology toward improvement conference](http://www.ambiguous.org/archive.php3/2004/02/26#quinn2004226.1) with tracks like:

- women and minorities
- democratizing education
- emerging markets
- personal sovereignty
- information dissemination

Sounds like it would be a good collaboration between [Ruckus](http://ruckus.org), and O’Reilly. ### Geek Organizer

Related news [MoveOn](http://moveon.org) is launching a [“Geek Organizer” online job fair](http://www.moveon.org/gojf/) (for a org which everyone says is so savvy, they make it incredibly difficult to link to their news) > Within our team, we’ve identified a crucial role we call (affectionately) the Geek Organizer. No, that’s not an organizer of geeks. It’s a person who combines the leadership and communication skills of a political organizer with the technical skills of a computer nerd. How rare are these people? We don’t know. But we know they exist, because we’ve built our organization around them.

I don’t know, seems every third person I know fits that description. ### CATS

Also the next Cascadia Anarchist Tech Skill-Share looks like it will be third weekend of March in Portland. [More info on the list](http://lists.riseup.net/www/info/cats). Chorus lines optional.
