A woman and a man riding the Green line, talking, somewhere between Arlington, and Boylston.

Women says to the man, “I told John we had 280 hours of work before the August 1st meeting and he said, ‘And that’s before shredding’.”

Man, “Wow.”

Woman, “Yeah. I was kind of hoping we could hire someone so we had time to do this right, and maybe avoid shredding.” Man, “Architecture is just like that.”

Woman, “Yeah I know.”

Me, I’m a little nervous to walk to close to any of those new buildings going up around Boston.
