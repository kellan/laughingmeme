Once you have a dozen (well really a baker\''s dozen) people each sharing several tadalists with you, how are you supposed to keep track of them?  I\''m really surprised that I can\''t find them all from my own personal tadalist install. For now they\''re going on the wiki, but I\''d like to flag the fact that the todo lists + easy group forming is not yet a solved problem.'

So does anyone have a solution for [TadaList](http://tadalist.com) proliferation? Once you have a dozen (well really a baker’s dozen) people each sharing several tadalists with you, how are you supposed to keep track of them? I’m really surprised that I can’t find them all from my own personal tadalist install. For now they’re going on the wiki, but I’d like to flag the fact that the todo lists + easy group forming is not yet a solved problem.
