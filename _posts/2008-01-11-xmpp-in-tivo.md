> “Today each TiVo polls TiVoâ€™s severs roughly every 15 minutes to check for new scheduled recordings, TiVoCast downloads, Unbox downloads, etc. Thatâ€™s highly inefficient – nearly all of those polling calls are for nothing. There is nothing waiting to be done. And it introduces a lag when you want to start a download – up to 15 minutes. And it doesnâ€™t scale well as TiVoâ€™s user base keeps growing.

> So whatâ€™s changed? The polling system is gone. TiVo is using XMPP now instead. What is XMPP? The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol – better known as the instant messaging protocol that powers Jabber, Google Talk, and other IM systems.” – \[Peter St. Andre\](https://stpeter.im/?p=2131) noticed as interesting announcement coming out of CES.
