Thinking about what “personal data stores” are going to look like, how this interacts with [decentralized models for community services](http://laughingmeme.org/2005/10/28/interestingness-community-infrastructure-and-the-academy/), (I swear I’ve written something more recent then 2005 on that topic, but can’t find it), mulling [models for updating clouds](http://laughingmeme.org/2007/05/18/slideshare-social-software-for-robots/), wondering if projects like G’s OpenSocial, and Portable Social Networks are a step forward or back, speculating that [digital curation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_curation) is a viable near future business model, and that individual curations would work well as [shareable social media objects](http://www.rashmisinha.com/2006/08/my-slides-for-webvisions-designing-for-social-sharing).

Nothing necessarily novel. Just where my head is at.
