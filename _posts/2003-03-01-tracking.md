I revived tracking, its no longer a web-based aggregator, just a boring old blogroll.

### XML::Simple is dangerous

I was going to use this project to play with XSLT again, figuring that transforming the trivial OPML export from Straw into the trivial target HTML would be trivial. I spent about 10 minutes thinking about how to do it, and playing with XSLT. About 2 minutes swearing at the XSLT spec. And 30 seconds coding a solution with XML::Simple. `XMLin()` is like a drug, it saps your will to “do things right.”
