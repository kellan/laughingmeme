Massachusetts CIO Peter Quinn, as part of his stated goal to [move all state and local IT systems to open source](http://www.govtech.net/magazine/story.print.php?id=87471), has launched an [open source code respository](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=74&e=4&u=/cmp/20040319/tc_cmp/18400894) for the public sector to do shared development and best practices. The site has an impressive pedigree ([via](http://www.dehora.net/journal/))

> The repository will consist of a MySQL database, Z Object Publishing Environment application server, Apache Web server, OpenLDAP authentication service for storing membership data, and Debian Linux operating system running on an Intel-based rack-mounted server. The University of Rhode Island will serve as the repositoryâ€™s home.

Quinn has come under attack for his support of open source, most notably from a group called [Citizens Against Government Waste](http://www.cagw.org/), a [pro-Microsoft lobbying group](http://lwn.net/Articles/54136/) (who can afford to use [Convio](http://convio.com)).
