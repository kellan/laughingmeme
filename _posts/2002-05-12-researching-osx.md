My mom’s iBook suffered an alarming kernel panic today. “No driver available for this hardware.” I’m searching for some discussion of this problem as Apple’s Knowledge Base information sucks. (“make sure you are running Mac compatible hardware”, “make sure you have a system folder”).

So far I haven’t found much, but finding lots of other goodies:

- [Unix type hints](http://www.kung-foo.tv/xtips.php), including installing XFree86, Fink and windowmaker.
- [MacOSX Hints.com](http://www.macosxhints.com) seems to have good stuff
- [Apple’s Unix -&gt; OS X porting guide](http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Darwin/PortingUNIX/index.html)
- [Getting OSX Going](http://www.ourpla.net/guiunix/GettingXGoing.html), cluttered but informative

Hmm, complete re-install of the system, and still getting the same error. ![:(](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png)This [thread at MaxFixit](http://www.macfixitforums.com/php/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=Forum35&Number=368700&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&part=) has some good suggestions that might help someone. They don’t help me.
