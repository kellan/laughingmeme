[SeattleWireless.net](http://SeattleWireless.net) is a cool project. However they haven’t built their information architecture to answer my question (a forgiveable oversight, if just barely), “Where are the free wireless coffee shops?”

Now that I’m a Seattle resident, I decided it was time to be able to answer this question. Here is my initial list , I haven’t visited all (or almost any) of these places yet, I can’t speak to the quality of the coffee (its Seattle, I’m not too worried), or atmosphere (see previous note), availability of power outlets (more worrying) or even continued existence of wireless, free or otherwise.

### Cafes I’ve been To

- [Aurafice Internet &amp; Coffee Bar](http://www.aurafice.com/), 616 E. Pine (Capitol Hill). 860-9977. Grand-daddy of wireless cafes, a key Seattlewireless node, major goth hang out scene, I don’t remember too much about the space, but the first version of [Magpie](http://magpierss.sf.net) was written during [my first visit](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000039.html).
- Zeitgeist Art and Coffee, 171 S. Jackson (Pioneer Square). 583-0497. I’ve raved too much about Zeitgeist already, see [previous](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000973.htm) [entries.](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001097.html)
- [Sophia’s Fremont Coffee](http://www.fremontcoffee.net/), 459 N. 36th St. (Fremont). 632-3633. *added: 2003/8/24*This rambling house of a coffee shop has the only hand painted “Wi-Fi Internet Access” sign I’ve ever seen. And a great back patio. (Sans power outlet though, come with a full battery) The owner is cool, linux using herbalist who also makes [gourmet soda](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/118683_realsoda23.html) in the basement.
