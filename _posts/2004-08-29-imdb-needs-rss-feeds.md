I’d like to be able to subscribe to an RSS feed of my favorite writers, directors, and actors to find out when they have new projects going into production, or about to be released. For example, I’m just finding out about [Silver City](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000626/), which means I’ve totally lost the fun of anticipating it for months already.

Ideally [IMDB](http://imdb.com) would supply these feeds as screen scraping is never a good option, but I’ve got to say IMDB is up there in the top 20 or so easiest sites to screen scrape, the format has been largely static for *years*, and the URLs are simple, if not particularly flexible.

Anyone?
