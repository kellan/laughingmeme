I released [cvs2rss v0.2](http://laughingmeme.org/code/cvs2rss/) (the “Fading Dawn” release) yesterday. Its only a minor tweak of cvs2rss 0.1 which has been happily working for me for a month now. (and needed surprisingly little fixing given that it came into this world [under a cloud](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000296.html#000296)) [Ben announced it](http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/004170.html#004170), but I figured I should probably put something on my own site about it ![:)](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

Some future directions

- Handle interactive CVS prompt better
- Make the project self hosting
- Make the config file more powerful
- Incorporate all the lovely user feedback I get (hint)

Some [example feeds](http://dev.protest.net/~kellan/cvs-rss/) I currently track.
