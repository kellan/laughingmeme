Presumably the [new del.icio.us feature “Your Network”](http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/04/its*made*out*of.html) is just the start of a roll out as it falls a bit short of the [hope and promise](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2005/10/26/del-icio-us-actually-getting-social) from Joshua’s [talk at Berkman last year](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/berkman*joshuas\_news.html).

Two most critical missing features \* tags from my network (otherwise I just have a new link stream to drown in) \* what did my network think of this link? (as an API!)

Also I want multiple networks. \* if the brilliance of del.icio.us is it allows me to simply express the various vectors of my interest, shouldn’t my interest in having someone in my network (which is opaque, and 1-directional, and definitionally about interest, not squishy social stuff) have as rich an expressive language?
