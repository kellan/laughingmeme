[diveintomark](http://diveintomark.org) was already a great place to explore what it best about weblogs. He mixes personal insights, with a keen insight into the web, and w3c standards, and what it makes it all tick. Its personal, and informative, by turn. Now he seems to be creating [a narrative about web accessibility](http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/30_days_to_a_more_accessible_weblog/index.html). Fascinating.
