Okay folks, the deal is: I release my code as open source, and you point out to me when its broken, and I’ve made dumb mistakes. Thats how it works.

At some point I seem to have reverted my patches to Snoopy that allowed Magpie to fetch feeds via SSL. This was working in my local version (which I use in conjunction with [FoF](http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/) to read my [private RSS feeds](http://labs.silverorange.com/archives/2003/july/privaterss)), but not in any publicly available version.

Guess I’m the only freak who wants to read RSS feeds via SSL. ([Mark](http://wingedpig.com) more or less confirmed this.)

Grab the latest version of [extlib/Snoopy](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/magpierss/magpierss/extlib/Snoopy.class.inc), if you’re so inclined. Or wait, and I’ll probably put out a new release in a few weeks. Note: Snoopy supports SSL through the expedient, if ugly, approach of exec’ing curl. This isn’t going to work on all shared hosts. Also you need to set the curl\_path variable at the stop of Snoopy to point to wherever you’ve installed it. (though now you’ll get an error message if it can’t be found)
