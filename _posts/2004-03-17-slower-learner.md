The last few days the has been a lot of banter in the blogosphere (and the corporate media which seems to be playing catch up lately at the off the cuff, uninformed punditry) about how Al-Qaeda threw the Spanish election (and whether that was their intent)

I’ve got an alternate proposal, Anzar is a slow learner. It was just exactly a year ago that he should learned the lesson [you don’t mess with the Spanish media](http://www.prandial.com/archives/2003_04.html#005793). Instead he tried to [personally stage manage](http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20040316-014634-4441r) the response to Madrid’s tragedy.

Even more importantly though, the people had just discovered their power, and their voice. Give it a few months, a year, and they’ll be tamped down, boxed away in their houses in front of their televisions, back to their own pursuits, but come election day they hadn’t yet forgotten.
