It’s a fixture of popular culture, the young feeling 20-30 something who comes face to face with a younger generation who describes old as something the 20-30 year old has already attained.

Happened to me tonight. I had a group of UW students sit down at the table next to me, and they started talking about one of their siblings who was 27, which they universally agreed was *OLD*.

Interestingly they also were joking/fretting about graduating from UW next year with nothing on their resumes except “Summer Camp, age 16”.

Which reminded me of a letter I received from Social Security yesterday (on nice, heavy, off-white paper) informing me that:

- I now qualify for Social Security
- if I went on disability now I’d qualify for $1,500+/monthly
- if we don’t change the laws Social Security will be depleted by 2042 (the year I turn 65).

Then, some what shockingly, they listed my past 13 years of taxable income. I can’t believe its already been that long. How did it go by so fast?
