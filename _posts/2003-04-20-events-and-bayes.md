Inspired by a post to the python-list about using [spambayes](http://spambayes.sf.net) to [classify defunct or out of date event listings](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2003-March/155527.html),(via [Uche Ogbuji](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3025)), and a recent chat with [Kendall](http://clark.dallas.tx.us/kendall/) I started playing with using it to identify spammed or inappropriate listings on Protest.net (and by extension other open publishing web applications). Initial progress was not promising. I think it’s going to be need more time then a distracted afternoon at <acronym title="who I'm not linking to because their
website resizes your window">Coffee Exchange</acronym> when I was really supposed to be working on a cover letter or revising the resume.

The net simply wasn’t converging (learning) fast enough to get useful results. I think that I need to spend some time thinking about my token choices, which will be substantially different then those used for email, to really get this to work.

Deep down I really feel like these learning, emergent technologies are going to be an important enabler for the new wave of web experimentation going on under the moniker “social software”.
