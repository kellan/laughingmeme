Tim [is the latest convert](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/04/09/Canon-S90) to [Canon S90](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LITT42?ie=UTF8&tag=laugmeme-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002LITT42)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=laugmeme-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002LITT42), and does a nice job of covering the highlights.

It really is a lovely camera, and the only point and shoot to come out in **years** that excited me. I knew I was intrigued when \[Amit\](http://www.amitgupta.com/), and \[Scott\](http://laughingsquid.com/), and \[MSG\](http://msg.tumblr.com/) all picked one up. We’ve had ours since January, and I’m immensely pleased with it.

Check out \[Jasmine’s S90 photos\](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=63105678@N00&amp;cm=canon/powershot*s90&amp;s=int), and \[mine\](http://www.flickr.com/search/?&amp;cm=canon/powershot*s90&amp;s=int&amp;w=51035734193@N01)

Though I am thinking about \[picking up the custom grip\](http://www.lensmateonline.com/newsite/richard*franiec*accessoriesS90.html), as it is slippery, especially in larger hands.
