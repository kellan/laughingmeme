There was a period, which at the time seemed to go on forever (something to do with the banal conversations) but in retrospect was relatively short, in which ‘disintermediating’ was the hottest buzz word around and everyone wanted to be doing it. It was the wave of the future, and to anyone in the industry obviously inevitable; just like online pet food stores. Which is by way of saying, Sourceforge is now positioning itself as an intermediary for funding open source software development.

Sourceforge is hoping to be a central location where you can donate to individuals, projects, open source foundations, and of course Sourceforge. In exchange for handling the donations (and in the hope of being more sustainable) SF will take a 5% cut on all transaction (accept donations to Sourceforge, in which case they take a 100% cut one would suppose). The system needs work both from a technical (they currently only support payment via PayPal!?!), and conceptual (I don’t think this, or the recently announced bounties are going to be all that effective), but it is nice to see people experimenting with different funding models.

I’ve included the introduction to the project that was sent out in the Sourceforge developers newsletter, as it doesn’t seem to have been published online anywhere.

It has been a success and I would like to thank everyone who has given to SourceForge.net and welcome further donations. You can view contributors here at: http://sourceforge.net/supporters.php
