Been meaning to upgrade for forever, but comment spam finally pushed it to critical early this week. And there went my Sunday.

### Not Seeing Eye to Eye with WordPress

\[Wordpress\](http://wordpress.org) was my first choice. I’ve tried upgrading to WP for a few times, but each times I try I get stymied. WP just isn’t flexible enough out of the box and the code is badly in need of refactoring. Might just be an impedance mismatch between me and WP.

### Typo, Up On a Too High Pedestal

Next up was \[Typo\](http://typo.leetsoft.com/). Now I **know** there is a codebase that is poetry, Typo is the gold standard of Rails apps, and I’ve referred to it when coding my own Rails apps.

Unfortunately when I checked on `#typo`, the recommended upgrade path from MT2.x was via MT3.x, and it doesn’t use the MT’s import/export feature, but rather direct database manipulation.

### Moveable Type 3, the Sound of Settling

So now I’ve got a running \[MT3\](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) install, and I think I’m just going to stay here, at least for tonight. I am struck again how much **polish** \[6A\](http://www.sixapart.com/) puts into their apps. Bayesian comment filtering looks promising, Brad’s tagging implementation looks promsing, and I’ve always liked MT’s <acronym title="Domain Specific Language">DSL</acronym> for templates. (that said I’m currently missing the flexibilty of ERB + layouts)

Not sure I’m going to stay there, but I’m staying there for tonight, as I’m tired.
