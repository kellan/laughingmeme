Jasmine posted some photos of Broad Cove from our recent road trip. Broad Cove was founded in 1757 by Martin Teel her n-th great grandfather though the original family land grant was near Petite Rivi√®re, they moved down to the area that became Broad Cove after the Scottish brothers who originally held the land returned to Scotland. (also **thats** how you link to a multi-tag page on Flickr, not that its documented anywhere)
