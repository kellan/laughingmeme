I’m a big fan of lightweight, ridiculously easy group forming, and of Mark Fletcher’s work, so I’m excited about [SnapGroups](http://www.snapgroups.com/). More interesting to me though is to see he chose to use [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/), as Mark handrolled a custom datastore to Bloglines. Validates some of my cautious optimism for Mongo delivering on some of its promise.
