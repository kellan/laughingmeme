I’ve just posted to the [new Flickr Developer blog](http://code.flickr.com/blog/) a list of all the various [Flickr folks](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2008/04/18/web-20-expo-youre-in-our-town-now/) speaking at next weeks Web 2.0 Expo. Also, if you haven’t seen it, take a spin around the rest of [code.flickr](http://code.flickr.com), a new site for the Flickr development community that launched this week, and has been brewing as side project since time immemorial.
