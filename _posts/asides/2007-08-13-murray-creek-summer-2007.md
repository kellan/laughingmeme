Murray Creek is the “ancestral home” of my Dad’s side of the family. Given the transience which is the growing norm in my community (I’ve got a baker’s dozen of moves in the last decade), its interesting to be reminded how much we are shaped by place. My vanishingly small sample size suggests this pattern of family homes where we can have space and go back to the land are increasingly common as we give up roots and space and place in our daily lives.
