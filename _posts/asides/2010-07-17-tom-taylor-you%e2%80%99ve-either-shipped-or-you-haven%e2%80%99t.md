“You’ve either poured weeks, months or even years of your life into bringing a product or a service into the world, or you haven’t. If you have, you’ll know what I’m talking about. You’ll have flicked a switched, cap deploy‘d, or flipped your closed sign to open, and just waited – holding your breath for whatever happens next.”
