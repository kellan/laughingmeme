[GeoURL](http://geourl.org) recently put me in touch with a fellow [Providence blogger](http://tuttlesvc.org) similarly struggling with the vagaries of RSS aggregation, community publishing, and Udell evangelism (which I’ve been falling down on lately). He also promises to proselytize this all to the educational computing community (who don’t even know what [Zoe](http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/) is!), but apparently they aren’t using good enough RSS aggregators to keep up.
