Somedays apt-get is the most infuriating piece of software. I’ve got the Debian package for python2.2 installed, I want to uninstall the Debian python2.1, but apt-get won’t allow me to do that without installing libperl5.8. Excuse me? I need to upgrade to the latest perl to uninstall an old version of python? In other news, perl5.8 is finally in Debian ![:)](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)
