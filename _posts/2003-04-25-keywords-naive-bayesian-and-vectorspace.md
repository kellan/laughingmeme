Martin has a new essay, [Keywords, Naive Bayesian and VectorSpace: Three Approaches to Searching](http://traumwind.de/computer/search/three_approaches_to_searching.html). Keeps pushing the automatic classification heresy, down with keyword searches!

I always wondeedr why it was called “naive bayesian”, Martin explains this is because the technique is neither bayesian nor naive. It all makes sense now.
