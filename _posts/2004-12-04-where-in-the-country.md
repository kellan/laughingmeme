Still in procrastination mode. Sorry to anyone who subscribes to this feed for substance. (anyone?)

Found an online survey [Find Your Spot](http://findyourspot.com), which purports to recommend where in the US you might like to live. I found the results interesting.

In order: Little Rock (??), Portland, Baltimore (??), Honolulu (does everyone get that?), DC, **Providence**, Eugene, **Santa Cruz**, New Haven, **Boston**, Corvallis, Hartford, Ventura (??), **San Francisco**, Baton Rouge (??), New Orleans (totally ignored my comments on humidity), Fayetteville, Charleston, Sacramento (no thank you!), Santa Barbara, Salem (OR), Frederick (MD), Worcester

Little Rock? As the #1 place I should move? I have my doubts.

I’m surprised by how many Southern cities were on the list since I’ve never considered living in the South and I’ve thought about living all over the world. I wonder if the problem is me or the website? Also tended to skew towards smaller cities then I would have expected.

Interestingly I’ve either lived in, been to, or grew up in almost every city on the list. (and frankly I’m a little surprised Seattle didn’t make the cut)
