Its been a [gorgeous snowy day](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/snow_day), enough to soften the heart of an avowed Californian. Boston is covered in a thick, thick blanket of heavy white snow. Its alternated between big drifting clumps, and determined, wind driven flakes, but either way, they cast their glamour upon this old, beat up city. It was also perfect snow ball snow this morning, but as everyone around me is sick I had to control myself, alas, these opportunities come so rarely. Now weâ€™re safely tucked away for the night with Nutella, and hot chocolate, and the latest catalog from [Kid Robot](http://kidrobot.com), and while perhaps the city sounds can be heard over the sweep of easy wind and downy flake, its very picturesque.

So besides my fumbling attempts to find a rationale for spending $300 on one of the new 12in Brothersworker doll (I like [Smart in Grey](http://kidrobot.com/kidspecs/smart12gy-2.html)), life is very good indeed.
