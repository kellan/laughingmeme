According to the [Associated Press](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-CVN-Protests.html?ex=1251864000&en=f4bc707bf2055f8d&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland) State Supreme Court Justice John Cataldo ordered the immediate release of 470 protestors being held illegally and *fined the city $1,000 for every protester held past a 5 p.m. deadline*.

> “These people have already been the victims of a process,” state Supreme Court Justice John Cataldo told the city’s top lawyer. “I can no longer accept your statement that you are trying to comply.”

Or in the words of [one judge](http://nyc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/115008/index.php)

> I have been here since 5:00 [2:30 hours] and only 20 people have been released. What is taking so long?!
