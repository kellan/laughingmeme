In Seattle these last few weeks of constant cold, wet, grey Summer days has been a bit much (especially compared to last year’s beautiful September). Thankfully it is now officially Fall, and all this clammy shivering can be normalized. And I’ll be back from California in a couple of days.

**update:** [photos of Mendocino](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/mendocino04); some of this weekend’s wedding, but mostly of the coast.
