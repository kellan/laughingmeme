Apple has released [iCal.app](http://www.apple.com/ical), though only for Jaguar. An example of the [publish to web](http://ical.mac.com/WebObjects/iCal.woa/1/wa/default?wosid=JYUwiNB36W1ZNRJjICJK90&d=10&u=hungerf3&v=0&y=2002&m=8&n=Work32Schedule.ics) feature is available, which is great as we’re just starting to do a redesign of the calendars on [protest.net](http://protest.net). (though I don’t think Apple gets it right for once)

I’m really curious how the publish-subscribe mechanism is being handled and if its really going to be possible to bypass .Mac. So far all we know is:

- [Apple Knowledge Base 61079](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61709#faq3) saying “…[p]ublish one of your calendars to a private WebDAV server. For information on setting up WebDAV on Mac OS X Server, consult the [Mac OS X Administrators guide](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=122015).”
- Apple has introduced a new URI scheme, `webcal://`, which you can see in action in the [events library](http://www.apple.com/ical/library).
