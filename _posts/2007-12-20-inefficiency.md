> “…it should take energy and thought to push issues upstream due to the associated costs of having to deal with them once they are propagated… when you optimise something you always do so at the expense of something else.” – \[Bill de hOra\](http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/12/16/manufacturing-content/)

> “Social technologies that make things more efficient reduce the cost of action. Yet, that cost is often an important signal. We want communication to cost something because that cost signals that we value the other person, that we value them enough to spare our time and attention. Cost does not have to be about money. … Spending time with someone is a valuable signal that you care.” – \[Danah Boyd\](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/12/14/valuing\_ineffic.html)
