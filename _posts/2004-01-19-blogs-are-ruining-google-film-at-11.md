Just to rehash the old “blogs are ruining Google meme”, my post from Saturday on [my experience upgrading to Panther](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001647.html#001647) is currently the top search results for [in the jungle, the mightly jungle](http://www.google.com/search?q=in+the+jungle+the+mighty+jungle&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8). That is unjustifiable.
