\[AOE media\](http://www.aoemedia.com/), a \[TYPO3 &amp; open source provide\](http://www.aoemedia.de/typo3-agentur.html) from Germany, recently agreed to become a sponsor on Magpie. Which is very exciting!

Looking around I see being sponsored by \[AOE Media\](http://aoemedia.com) puts me in good company as they sponsor a number of interesting projects, including my favorite wiki software \[Doku\](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki)

I’m hoping this will allow me to actually spend a little time with Magpie, maybe finally find the time to re-vamp the website into something a little more functional.

And last if you’re someone interested in sponsorship work as a whole on Magpie, or specific feature development get in touch.

Thanks again \[AOE Media\](http://aoemedia.com).
