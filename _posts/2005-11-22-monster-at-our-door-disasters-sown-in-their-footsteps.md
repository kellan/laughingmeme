I’m currently reading [Mike Davis’ “The Monster At Our Door: Global Threat of Avian Flu”](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1595580115?v=glance), and finding it very interesting.

In particular I’ve been unexpectedly struck by how much like raving, leftist loonies dedicated moderates sound when they start writing comprehensively about current events. First Jared Diamond with Collapse, and now Mike Davis. (also, unfortunately, I think this book will firmly cement Davis, one of my favorite authors, into the “Prophet of Doom” ghetto)

Turns out that the key factors pushing the evolution and possible pandemic rise of an avain flu super killer (**best case** says 50 million dead, worst case as many as 1 in 6) are **crony capitalism**, and **big multi-nationals** (global agribusiness). Meanwhile preparedness has been dramatically damaged by the **incompetence, and duplicity of the current administration**, its phony war on terror, its headline grabbing disaster, the Dept. of Homeland Security, and its deeply incestuous relationship with “Big Pharma”. (in fairness, it was also damaged by the previous administration, and the previous one, clearly traceable, like many modern ills, to the days of the Great Gipper)

I haven’t decided if its alarming or comforting to find our old friends, these familiar horsemen of modern apocalypse lurking behind yet another potential global disaster.
