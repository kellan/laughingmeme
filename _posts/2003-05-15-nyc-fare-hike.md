It looks like the [NYC fare hike may be rolled back.](http://www.ambiguous.org/archive.php3/2003/05/15#robin2003515.1) Which would be shocking. Just because the MTA provably lied through its teeth you don’t expect that to actually have any effect on the political outcome. And it still might not, as the there is alreay [a stay on the judges order](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/nyregion/AP-New-York-Transit-Fares.html).

My question is the same as Robyn’s
