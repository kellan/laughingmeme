According to this [Wired article](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59244,00.html) the Pentagon is transitioning to a “new Internet”, one that doesn’t drop “packets” (quotes in the original), and doesn’t use the “telephone-like numbering system”. Aka Pentagon is moving to IPv6 sometime in the future.

In other news when did Wired stop employing computer literate reporter?
