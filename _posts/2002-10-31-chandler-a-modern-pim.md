[Chandler](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000007.html) is Mitch Kapor’s new, much hyped, open vapour PIM. I feel like I have to blog it, being a calendar guy, but I can’t get excited about it. But maybe you can?

Afterall, Lotus Agenda rocked, [yoz talks about why it rocked](http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/000141.html#000141), in particular its free-form data entry. And free form data entry could be a lot cooler these days with a huge database (aka the Web) at our finger tips. Example, I say “Research projects named Chandler on Friday”, and Chandler can answer the question, [Who is Raymond Chandler?](http://www.googlism.com/index.htm?ism=raymond+chandler&type=1) (warning pop-up ad)

**Update, 11/1** Not so vapor? [Vista is a Chandler prototype](http://www.osafoundation.org/Vista_prototype.htm) in Python. Kapor talks about [managing vapor](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000033.html#000033).

**Update, 11/5** Went out with a bunch of ex-Lotus folks last Friday. We crowded into “the best dive bar in Somerville” to listen to a set of really bad rock with good wigs, followed by [Mark’s surprisingly good Buffalo Tom impressions](http://catapulttheband.com). Between sets, and “I didn’t know you were back in Boston”, people kept saying “when I heard about this, I thought of you, this is what you should be working on.” None of the members from the original Agenda team were there, but I’m thinking about IMing them.
