GOP members of the US Senate Judiciary Commitee [hacked into Democrats files](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/01/22/infiltration_of_files_seen_as_extensive/), and for over a year illegally monitored communications, and likely leaked some of those illegally obtained documents to Robert Novak.

That is shocking (and I thought I was beyond shocking).

And it’s a federal crime under the harsh laws that these people worked to pass. If these staffers had been 14 year old kids who read Slashdot, they would already be in prison. In an era where you can go to jail for sharing music, and where Sherman Austin got a year in federal prison for running a website, these staffers, and their bosses, should be prosecuted, and sent to prison for the full 10 years allowed under the “Fraud and related activity in connection with computer” statues.

And when they get out, I hope they live in a state that disenfranchises ex-felons.
