This post is for everyone who was part of the “peak oil” conversation at <acronym title="Cascadia Anarchist Tech Skillshare">CATS</acronym> last weekend.

A page from 1997 [predicting the year of occupation of Iraq](http://web.archive.org/web/19980113194457/dieoff.org/page128.htm) based on peak oil calculations. (via [random($foo)](http://randomfoo.net/))

We seem to have slightly accelerated the time line, but it was probably too much to imagine we’d have another oil baron back in the White House so soon.
