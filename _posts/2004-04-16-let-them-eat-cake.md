My neighborhood coffee shop, [Lighthouse Roaster](http://www.lucidcafe.com/cafeforum/lighthouse.html), is turning the [nationwide MoveOn bake sale event](http://www.moveon.org/pac/news/1000bakesales.html) into an excuse for a [block party, and multi-store event](http://action.moveon.org/bakesale/selectmtg.html?zip=98107&distance=10&event_type=Bake%20Sale): all proceeds go to MoveOn, donated good things from Essential Bakery.

I have my ambivalence about [MoveOn](http://moveon.org), but they get points for creativity, and Lightouse just rocks. Hope to see you there tomorrow. I recommend the cardamom cake. (via [jeff](http://www.idealog.us))
