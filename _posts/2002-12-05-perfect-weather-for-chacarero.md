If you’ve always meant to visit Chacarero but never made it, nows your chance. I was just there, and in sub-freezing weather, there were only a dozen or so people in front of me choosing to get snowed on for their sandwhich. Normally a significant portion of the population of Boston seems to be on queue, but all winter (its supposed to be a bad one) you’ll have your chances at a chacarero without the lines. (yay! for outdoor eating)

For the uninformed Chacarero is one of a handful of reasons to live in Boston. It serves chacareros, a delicacy we are told is a traditional Chilean sandwich, out of a take-away counter next of Filene’s in Downtown Crossing ([426 Washington St, Boston](http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&addr=426+Washington+Street+&csz=Boston+MA+&Get%A0Map=Get+Map)). The sandwhich starts with made fresh daily on premise, light, cake-like cornmeal bread, sliced in half, spread with mashed avocado, the only decent looking tomatoes in Boston, roasted red peppers, Muenster cheese, a unique hot sauce, steamed green beans, and liberal salt and pepper. The overhaul taste is fresh, light, green, and complex.
