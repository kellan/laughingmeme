Realized the other morning that I had half an article written just looking at my notes from some recent PHP hacking. Looked around a bit for somewhere to publish it, but most of the places I might have sent a PHP article a few years ago don’t seem to be around, or at least not accepting submission. Suggestions on a good venue?

Or is that why I’ve got a personal publishing platform?
