I finally get it.

 So I looked at [Allconsuming](http://allconsuming.net) a few times, didn’t sign in, didn’t really get it.

Went back this morning, futzed with it, was confused by the interface for a little while, and then my head exploded. I’m in love. This is the site I was looking for when I wrote the [entry on book metadata](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000267.html), and its [author](http://erikbenson.com/) was kind enough to respond to my entry and too self-effacing to point out the obvious to me.

Its an amazing site, a beautiful web app (in a functional way), capitalizes on the new social, semantic distributed blogo network better then anything I’ve encountered, and is whip smart.

### Favorite flourish

I clicked on the “edit friends list”, with a certain trepidation, as I never know the protocols for declaring someone “a friend” in these online communities. Allcomsuming short circuited this problem by asking Google who my friends are:  
[rabble](http://www.anarchogeek.com), [dru](http://misnomer.dru.ca), [micah](http://riseup.net/~micah/nerf), [pseudopunk](http://pseudopunk.be/), and a few names I didn’t recognize. Wild. Also [community driven meta-data](http://www.allconsuming.net/news/000026.html#000026)! ### Next Step

You are supposed to integrate Allconsuming with your site using one of those cool javascript include thingys (which protest.net v2 is going to have in abundance), and while I think they are cool, I’m going to spend a little bit this morning working up a script to talk to AC’s SOAP interface instead. Sorry to burrble so early in the morning, but I’m excited.

By the way, I went back and gave Allconsuming a second look, after reading about DJ Adams’ (of Jabber fame) [booktalk](http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/2003/01/20#allconsuming) which in turn tracks its heritage to Jon Udell’s [LibraryLookup](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html) service, which allows you to browse your local library from Amazon (no support for Providence Public yet), and [his column](http://staging.infoworld.com/articles/ap/xml/03/01/06/030106apapps.xml?template=/storypages/printfriendly.html) on said service.(via [snowdeal](http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2003_01_19_index.html#90216441))
