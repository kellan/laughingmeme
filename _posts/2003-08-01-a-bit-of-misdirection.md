Burningbird has a [great post](http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001393.htm) discussing the Bush’s [latest homophobic behaviour](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/01/1059480556511.html), the “Wag the Dog” like timing of it all (steering us away from asking the president hard questions back into the quagmire of [permacontroversy](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000949.html)), and ties it to the ongoing [cultural attack on feminism.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,988446,00.html)

[In the same post](http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001393.htm) she also looks at how (and why) the Catholic church is shifting the debate.

Finally a friend asked me to pass along the [Millions for Marriage](<http://www.millionformarriage.org >) petition, I’m not sure I believe in online petitions or a state regulated notion of marriage, but there you go.
