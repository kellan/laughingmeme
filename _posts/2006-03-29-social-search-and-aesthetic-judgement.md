Great quote from Thomas Hawk \[comparing image search engines\](http://thomashawk.com/2006/03/more-on-new-search-betas-from.html)

> “If I were Google and Microsoft right now I’d be thinking about where I could find about 2 million or so users to rank my pictures on the cheap rather than wasting time on all this other stuff.”.

Still I think 2006+ is going to be about rediscovering that smart computers can help us get value from the rankings of handful of personally relevant opinions as well as 2M strangers in aggregate.

**update \[2006/4/3\]:** It was pointed out to me that Google has a stake in \[von Ahn’s\](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/) \[ESP game\](http://www.espgame.org/) (not to mention a whole new CMU/Pittsburgh lab focusing on data mining and AI).
