We’ve all heard the famous, “On the Internet no one knows you’re a dog.” (A saying which by and large pre-dates Google.) What about the reverse?

What if in person you’re a mild mannered geek, but on the Internet you’re an [800lb gorilla](http://boingboing.net)? Reading about [Cory’s run in with AA’s latest privacy outrage/policy](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/19/why_is_american_airl.html), I can just imagine the PR flack’s growing unease reading the analysis of the Uk Data Protection Act, turning into real panic when they read:

> I’m cc’ing this note to my colleagues at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to my friend John Gilmore who is currently suing the TSA over some of its regulations, and to the website I co-edit, Boing Boing (boingboing.net), which has over 200,000 daily readers. I will be very interested to hear your reply.

Off the internet, no one knows you’re an 800lb gorilla.
