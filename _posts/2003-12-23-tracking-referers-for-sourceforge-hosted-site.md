Hosting a project with Sourceforge is great. They provide bandwidth, CVS with anonymous access (something I never set up on my own boxes), and above all, a certain credibility. But they donâ€™t provide good traffic analysis. There was some recent discussion if people were actually finding Magpie searching for PHP RSS parsing, or if they were simple [searching for a picture of a magpie](http://images.google.com/images?q=magpie).

So here is a bit of Javascript that will fetch a remote image from your [Sourceforge project home page](http://magpierss.sf.net) and tack the original referer url to the image.

```

<script language="javascript">
var img = "http://example.org/bigbrother.gif"
var ref = parent.document.referrer;
document.write("<img src=\""+img+"?"+escape(ref)+"\">");
</script>

```

I imagine this is what someone like [SiteMeter](http://sitemeter.com) does.
