As a long time user of windowmaker, the idea of giving up my workspaces is unthinkable. In fact its been the most frustrating part of working on OS X when Iâ€™ve played with it.

[Space, virtual workspaces for OS X](http://space.sourceforge.net/) looks to solve that problem. And, with so many things that seem to migrate from the traditional Unix sphere to OS X, its look damn attractive when it gets there.

Early version. Released under the QPL. Actively looking for developers.
