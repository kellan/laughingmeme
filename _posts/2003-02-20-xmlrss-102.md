[XML::RSS 1.02](http://search.cpan.org/author/KELLAN/XML-RSS-1.02/) just hit CPAN. This fixes a stupid oversight in my `encode()` method that caused it to mangle data wrapped in a CDATA section. (Maybe I should blame [Matt Sergeant](http://use.perl.org/~Matts/), I stole the code from him.)

This is also the first release since I took over maintainership from `brian d foy`, and consquently the first place on CPAN where my name appears. Iâ€™m very excited.

My name, in lights!
