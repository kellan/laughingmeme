There are 2 reasons to use RSS 2.0, one is you really like Dave Winer, and you think it is important to stroke his ego, the other is that you’re scared of RDF. So when [Marc says](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/10/05.html#a1807):

> Yes – we know that RDF can do many of the things RSS-Data was designed for. But (believe it or not) it really has nothing to do with RSS 1.0 at all. RSS-Data is about extending RSS 2.0. OK? Not RSS 1.0.

I’m kind of surprised.  We obviously can’t be wanting RSS-Data to do just the same thing as RDF otherwise, presumably, one would just use RSS 1.0; after all no one seems to be arguing that RSS-Data does a **better** job then RDF at the arbitrary structuring of data game. But at some fundamental level, (and having watched the RSS scene for a number of years now I should expect it) I’ve just never really accepted the idea that there are really **that** many people who care about Dave Winer’s ego. It just makes no sense.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not the world’s biggest fan of RDF, I don’t think it magically solves all problems. Partially because I’m not sold on the idea of arbitrary data structures, an approach that seems to me to constantly defer the hard work in favor of the quick prototype. (a point Les explores in his [“I got my schema from Amazon, where did your’s comes from?”](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rss_data_and_schema.html) post) But if you’re going to do it, then at least [do it right](http://www.w3.org/RDF/).

Or as Tom put it so well:
