Aaron’s released \[upcalendar\](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2006/08/04/zebra/#upcalendar), the latest barrage in his Web2.0 on S60 campaign.

And 30Boxes has \[m.boxes.com\](http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/2006/08/09/30boxes-mobile-m30boxescom/).

Got to say the \[mobile page\](http://oscal.quxx.info/m) for OSCAL (now defunct as its smart enough to only show upcoming events), was by far my favorite part of the app.

Turns out mobile is sexy, useful, and fun but not all that hard. Who knew?

All of which goes back to my an idea I’ve been kicking around for a bit, sync is dead (which is good because sync is hard), instead we’ve got remote services, local caching, and change propagation. (which is largely understood) All the interesting work right now is on the tension between the client and the server.
