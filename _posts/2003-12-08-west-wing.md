On a tip from Jasmine I rented the first season of West Wing last week.  
I don’t remember the last I found television engaging and funny, but I think I it was probably while I was still watching Gummi Bears every Saturday morning. Saw a review from the Guardian describe the dialogue as “machine gun” and “hard to follow”. Be that as it may, the pacing plus lack of commercials (on DVD is the only way to watch TV) means it isn’t boring! How novel! No need cruise [IMDB](http://imdb.com) half way through for random trivia. Add dry, bitter wit, and a president intelligent enough to remember the rules to chess, and I’m thourghly amused.

One problem with my televsion watching technique; only the 1999 season is available on DVD here in the US. In the UK they’ve also got season 2, but um, where are the rest? Hello? Big evil corporate media moguls? Please release more.

Also, I seem to be the only person who likes Toby, the shows unsung hero in my book, tied for my favorite character with the rabble rousing reporter character (big surprise?) whose name I’ve forgotten.
