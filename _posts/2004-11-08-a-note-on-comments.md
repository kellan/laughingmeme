Just a quick note on the state of comments on this blog. The blog spam has gone through the roof in the last few weeks as a number of people have noted. I don’t have time to deal with this, so currently I’m just leaving it. This does mean that there is a good chance I won’t see your comments in the next week, email me if you want to reach me. (which the exception of this post, which I’ll be monitoring for responses)

Currently I’m evaluating my options:

- move to WordPress, this got bogged down in my desire to totally overhaul my category system, and re-design this website.
- move to MT3.1 and hope to the comment moderation code either works or is hackable (any experience anyone?)
- hack comment moderation into MT2 (I’ve searched for a plugin, but haven’t found one, again anyone?)
