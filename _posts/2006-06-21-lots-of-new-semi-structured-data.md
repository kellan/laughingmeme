Showed up at Microformats party last night and promptly fell asleep in my drink (long day), but *this* is the real action. [Andy](http://waxy.org) and Y!Local have [rolled out hCard, hCal, and hReview](http://ylocalblog.com/blog/2006/06/21/we-now-support-microformats/) to all of [Yahoo Local](http://local.yahoo.com).

And [Gordon](http://getluky.net) has whipped up the first [microformat -&gt; to Y!](http://getluky.net/2006/06/21/dabbling-with-greasemonkey/) bridge with Greasemonkey.

Nice.
