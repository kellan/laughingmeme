The title is not a reference to New England’s freakish habit of lulling you into believing it’s Spring and then dumping snow on you. [<cite>Midsummer Snowballs</cite>](http://www.abramsbooks.com/books/MidsummerSnowballs.html) ([ac](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0810906244)) is a book by Andy Goldsworthy of [River and Tides](http://www.filmforum.com/rivers.html).

Its beautiful, but flipping through it I couldn’t help but think of the panic that depositing 13, 1-ton strange white balls in downtown New York would cause these days.
