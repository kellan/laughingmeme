\[WeatherNear.Me\](http://weathernear.me) is a prototype that got built as part of a larger weather based project \[Jasmine\](http://brandxculture.com/blog) and I were working on. It’s a “single serving site” that displays the weather near you. I had hoped to knock out a v2 with a bunch of new features during the break, but there were fun distractions.

Still it’s a straightforward example of using the [W3C Javascript Geolocation API (geoloc)](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) that works in Chrome, Firefox, and Mobile Safari, and it has a super cute iPhone home screen icon that \[Jasmine\](http://brandxculture.com/blog) designed.

V2 with more trending info, and personalization some day.
