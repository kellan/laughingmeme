Back when my dad drove his big yellow truck, delivering food for the food bank, he sometimes dropped me off at the Live Oak Senior Center industrial kitchen.

And every October I remember peering over the edge into the bowl of an industrial stand mixer taller then I was at a truly giant vat of pumpkin pudding.

And while I’m telling myself this pumpkin flavored Chobani yogurt is kind of a pumpkin pudding, it really isn’t.
