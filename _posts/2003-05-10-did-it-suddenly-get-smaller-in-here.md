[Eric](http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2003_05_01_index.html#200270106)and [Russel Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030509.html#095103) are both noticing the phenomena I was talking about a few months ago, namely: we keep finding ourselves everytime we Google. While thats nice and all from a ego boost stand point, if I wanted to talk to myself I don’t need to sit in front of a computer and have Google intermediate, I can go stumble down the street mumbling and muttering under my breath. They’re marking it up as “blognoise”, and I think thats part of it, but I’m still stuck on my idea of [linguistic convergence](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000346.html).
