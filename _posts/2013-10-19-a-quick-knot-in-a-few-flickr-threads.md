Paul Mison’s \[Maximum Viable Product\](http://notes.husk.org/post/63397973560/maximum-viable-product) feels like a more clever (if more cheeky) way to get at what I was trying to say with my notes on \[Flourishes\](http://laughingmeme.org/2011/06/02/flourishes-craftsmanship-dates-history-and-flickr/) and \[Minimal Competence\](http://laughingmeme.org/2010/05/18/minimal-competence-data-access-data-ownership-and-sharecropping/) (and \[Competence found\](http://laughingmeme.org/2013/02/10/competence/)), and threads the needle of recent \[4up from Aaron\](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2013/09/06/things/#4up) and \[The Flickr We Lost from Dan\](http://revdancatt.com/2013/10/07/the-flickr-we-lost/).

I don’t have much conclusion as much as a sense there’s a thing there that I’m still trying to get my hands around.

The other piece I wonder at about this is the role of sophisticated testing and measurements and being the user.

I hear that engagement is way up in the wake of Flickr’s changes, and I know I’ve been gone a long time and things have probably changed, but I can’t help but be struck how unsophisticated we were at measuring things at Flickr — in part because we were a tiny team, and in part because we relied on our instincts. It makes me wonder what’s guiding the current work.
