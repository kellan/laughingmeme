As the last bits of my room disappear away into boxes, I find the dismembered remains of the tavern puzzles that came with the house. An [Iron Heart](http://store.yahoo.com/tavernpuzzles/pz-irht.html) without the heart (hint: try sticking the heart’s tip through the eyes of the U), [Lyon’s Loop](http://store.yahoo.com/tavernpuzzles/pz-irht.html) without the ring (hint: try folding it), [Sneaky Pete](http://store.yahoo.com/tavernpuzzles/pz-snpt.html), also missing ring (hint: no idea), and a solved [Chinese Puzzle](http://store.yahoo.com/tavernpuzzles/pz-ptpz.html), intact, but god forbid I spend the years (literally) it would take to put it back into its unsolved position.

I don’t think these are coming with me to Seattle.
