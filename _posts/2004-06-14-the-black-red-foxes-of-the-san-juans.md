When Jasmine and I were in the San Juans last week it was a record low tide. Among the many sites were a pair of black foxes who had descended to the freshly exposed rocks to fish the tide pools. (same concept as shooting fish in a barrel, except at one point one of them shot straight up with a short yelp, I’m speculating a crab)

Now everyone I tell this to looks at me cross eyed, and says, “Umm, I’ve never heard of black foxes.” Tell the truth, neither had I. So I did some quick research and came across the following [red fox photo](http://www.theragens.com/photos/albums/Foxes/Red_Fox_2003-01.htm)

You’ll notice that bright red coloration right?

It’s kind of like white rhinos (which are grey) and black rhinos (which are also grey).
