After a bit of prodding, and a couple of detours, I’ve setup a wiki listing independent Seattle coffee shops with free or nearly free wireless access.

[Caffeinated and Unstrung: A Guide to Seattle’s Free Wireless Coffee Shops](http://laughingmeme.org:8081/unstrung/).

This supersedes the blog entry [The Wireless Cafes and Coffee Shops of Seattle](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001129.html), though some help copying, and expanding on the data from that entry would be greatly appreciated.

### Using the Wiki

Beyond a listing of caffeinated hotspots, the wiki is also an expirement in trying to have a moderately attractive wiki, with a moderately sensible, and self explanatory information architecture. Attractiveness is accomplished via CSS so you’ll need yourself a modern CSS understanding browser (Safari, Mozilla-kin, probably Opera though I haven’t tested it) to really participate fully. Information architecture is accomplished via backlinks, a poor man’s faceted classification (even though Kim has [explained backlinks != facets](http://www.kimbly.com/blog/000089.html)).

### More About Backlinks

Using backlinks for classification is a trick you see a lot on some of the old, established wikis, like [BooksShelved](http://bookshelved.org), but it seems to have not made it the latest generations of wiki users. You flag a page as describing an item (e.g. a coffee shop) in a category (e.g. [InBallard](/unstrung/?InBallard)) by linking to the category (if you look at [Mr. Spots](/unstrung/?MrSpotsChaiHouse) you’ll see Neighborhood: [InBallard](/unstrung/?InBallard)). Then category pages embed a backlink tag, which automagically lists all those items. Presto, categories!

Feel free to create new cateogries on the Wiki, but try to choose good names. Current categories are geographic ([InFremont](/unstrung/?InFremont), [InCapitolHill](/unstrung/?InCapitolHill), etc.), by roaster ([Illy](/unstrung/?Illy), [RavensBrew](/unstrung/?RavensBrew)) plus a handful of other like: [OpenLate](/unstrung/?OpenLate), [IsaKlebeckBrothersCafe](/unstrung/?IsaKlebeckBrothersCafe).

### Create an Account

If you’re going to be doing a lot of hacking, create yourself an account. You do this by creating a page with your username (a valid WikiWord), and then login via the Prefrences page.

### Maintainging the Look

Try starting with the [NewCoffeeShopTemplate](/unstrung/?NewCoffeeShopTemplate) when adding a new location. Don’t feel limited however to just providing the information in the template.

### Branding

Not sure about the name, don’t really have a URL for it. <cite>Caffienated and Unstrung</cite> sounded appropiate (or at least funny) at 1am this morning, it might have been contextual.

### What Wiki Software is That?

A slightly tweaked version of [Kwiki](http://kwiki.org), which my new favorite wiki, simple but reasonably powerful, well formed HTML (making CSS styling much easier), object oriented, and imminentlyhackable. Version .20 is supposed to support a really super plugin architecture, but in the meantime I’m using a subclassed of `Formatter` to support backlinks. Let me know if you want it.
