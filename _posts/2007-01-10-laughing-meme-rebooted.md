[![Warning](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/1/272639_d672938762.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/drift-words/272639/ "Photo Sharing")

About a month ago the creaky, heavily forked, and largely neglected version of Typo I was using to host [Laughing Meme](http://laughingmeme.org), started blowing its brains out. And for the preceding 6 months I had been losing the war against comment spam. Additionally I had reached the conclusion that while [Mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/) changes the game for [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) hosting, not enough to make it cost effective for a blogging platform. Time to reboot.

### WordPress

One month to the day, please welcome the new revived LM, now on [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org)!

This will mark my third attempt to migrate to WordPress, the last time was about 48 hours before I moved to Typo. Hopefully it will stick this time.

### Pardon the Dust

Lots of work still to do on templates (they work on my laptop! what’s your problem?), some links are broken, I haven’t spent as much time crafting the feed formats as I’d like (terribly out of character I know!), and **I haven’t migrated over the comments yet**. All the old links should work, and if you do find `404` please let me know. (Not only are the permalinks from my Typo install working, but also all of those from the MT install before it!)

### All One Big Stream

Given that most of my blogging lately has been link blogging, I’ve moved this content into the main stream (and the main feed). A separate feed just of links is still available, and as soon as I do a bit of hacking a stream of everything but links will also be available. I won’t however be pumping every bookmark, photo, twitter, and burp through this feed. Separate [temple of ego](http://adactio.com/extras/stream/) may someday appear, but no one will be auto-subscribed, I promise.

### WordPress Wants

Hey all you WordPress users. Do you know of plugins, snippets, or examples of:

1. Good WordPress tagging interface? Don’t make me revive my tags4wp code. Please
2. Stripped down posting interface?
3. Good archives?

### I Have No Blog, and I Must Share!

And by way of fair warning, I haven’t had a blog for a month, so expect updates to be a bit fast and furious for a while.

Thanks everyone for bearing with.
