[Factcheck.org](http://factcheck.org/) is a largely non-partisan site that says it “holds politicans accountable” (i.e. Snopes, but less fun). [Factcheck.com](http://factcheck.com) is a domain name squatter with a sense of humor.

Continuing my general experience with authority figures who seem to find the net inimical to their fascist tendencies, Cheney got confused by the difference, and so directed the million or so folks watching the debates tonight to [George Soros’ new blog](http://www.georgesoros.com/).
