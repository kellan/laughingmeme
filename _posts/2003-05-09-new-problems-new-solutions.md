If we want our network of ad-hoc access points to ever grow into something more then a quick place to check ones email, then we need a way to communicate between maintainer and user, explain the purpose of the AP, and what services are offered. The current way to do this is with [NoCat](http://nocat.org) or something like it, capture the users web traffic the first time they connect, and re-direct to an appropiate landing page. This is a “good enough” solution to me, but it makes Josh (who needs a blog) grumpy, as he is inclined to see slippery slopes in the darndest places.

### A Lot Less Slippery?

Rob “Community Wireless” Flickenger has a better solution, use Rendezvous Zeroconf mDNS, and goes on to show how he setup [service advertising on his Linux AP](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3175).
