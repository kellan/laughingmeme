One of my favorite books, Kim Stanely Robinson’s [<cite>Red Mars</cite>](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0553560735) is being made into [6 hour SciFi channel mini-series](http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-sfc.html?2003-06/06/12.30.sfc) by the producer of <cite>Hulk</cite>, and <cite>Terminator 3</cite> (films both well known for their realistic depictions of scientists) and written by the writer of <cite>Highlander</cite>, and <cite>Backdraft</cite> (who has consistently shown his senstivity when depicting debates of anarcho-syndicalism, and his real feel for slow, talky movies).

I’m so excited. Really. Can hardly wait.
