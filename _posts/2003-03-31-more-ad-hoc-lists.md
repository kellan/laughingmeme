Mailing lists are good for some things, and really really bad for most. In particular they scale poorly, both up and down. Many conversations suffer from crowded public space which a mailing list inhabits, one in which a rapid back and forth is either discouraged, or if allowed brings all other conversations to a screeching halt. One solution many people try is, “Start a new list”, which is why [lists.indymedia.org](http://lists.indymedia.org) had over 600 mailing lists last time I checked. Another is the private CC list which has the problems of being transient, difficult to join, difficult to remove yourself from, unstructured and unarchived.

I’ve proposed using [quicktopic.com](http://quicktopic.com) in the past, but people don’t seem to want to leave their email readers, and [kicked around](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000249.html) the idea of using [Roundup](http://roundup.sourceforge.net/), or at least extracting the ad-hoc list code from it.

### Simplify the Problem

More recently, chromatic is [rolling his own](http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/10954) using Mail::Audit, which looks very interesting.(hooray for the power of procrastination!)
