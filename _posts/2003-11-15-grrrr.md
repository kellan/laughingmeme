Losing writing is the most frustrating ever. My “sketch pad”, my small journal that I carry everywhere, and jot down notes, ideas, and short essay seems to have gone missing. I’ve got 3 entries in there I wanted to re-type today: notes from [Bujold’s](http://www.dendarii.com/) talk (finally), selected hilights from [Stiglitz](http://www-1.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/) (in prep for Thursday’s talk), and a short essay on the works of [Kristine Smith](http://www.kristine-smith.com/), and how [paper trails/verifiability](http://www.blackboxvoting.com/) are smacking up against one of our futurological tropes of “paperlessness as progress.”

So frustrating. Can’t forget them, but every time I sit down to rewrite I’m blocked by the knowledge I’ve done this once before, better.

If you happen to find a an 8x5in, narrow rule, spiral bound notebook with a grass green cover, full of illegible scrawls, please send it back to me, I’m adrift.
