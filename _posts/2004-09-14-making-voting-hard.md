I don’t know why government information architecture is so truly horrendous. I don’t think its malicious, but it so bad it might be.

If for example you were looking for where to vote in today’s Washington State primaries, I challenge you to find the information anywhere on [vote.wa.gov](http://vote.wa.gov), the URL which has been heavily push by a local advertising campaign.

From [DemocracyNet](http://dnet.org) (thanks to Tim for the tip) I was able to find a list of [contact information by county](http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/auditors.aspx), and from there jump to [King County elections site](http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/), where the simple form for [finding one’s polling place](http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/pollingplace/birthday.aspx) resides.

With all these accessibility guidelines government websites are forced to comply with, you think one of them would be, “website must be usable by someone of average intelligence.”
