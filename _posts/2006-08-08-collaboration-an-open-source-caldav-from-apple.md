I missed it, I’d even seen the inimitable [Wilfredo](http://www.wsanchez.net/blog/) on the lists and it went right by me, but I ran into [Nat](http://bumppo.net/) last night at [Buzz’s WWDC party](http://upcoming.org/event/93479/), and he rather riveted my attention (as I think he knew he would), that [iCalServer](http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/leopard/icalserver.html) announced yesterday? Turns out its an [open source CalDav server](http://collaboration.macosforge.org/), written in Python ([Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)), Apache 2.0 license, with great unit test coverage. (which bodes well for the trial by fire known as interop)

Btw. [Collaboration’s homepage](http://collaboration.macosforge.org/) seems to be a [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) install which is sputtering, and crying. Under load?

**update:** Um, and how long as [Cyrus Daboo](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22c.+daboo%22) been signing his emails “Apple Software Engineer”? Yup, I was asleep.

**update 2:** wsz [confirms trac unhappiness (and my Twisted inside observation)](http://www.wsanchez.net/blog/2006/08/darwin*calendar*server.html), I guess I just got in in time, if you email me, I’ll send you a tarball of the src.
