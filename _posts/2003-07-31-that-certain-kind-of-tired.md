I’m home, for values of home, where home equals Providence. It feels good to officially, if just for one night, be off the road. As Jessamyn said, [“I am that certain kind of tired now where I have been very very tense without really quite knowing it for a long period of time.”](http://www.jessamyn.com/journal/03/jul.shtml#24)

I am looking forward to spending sometime not engaging in my transportation shuffle which has consisted of 38 hours of bus travel, 19 hours of car travel, 12 hours of air travel, 7 hours of train/subway travel, and 2 nights spent on the road unable to sleep in the last 4 weeks.

I discovered today that I am 1 degree of separation from Jessamyn via both [gus](http://gus.protest.net) (who [blows bubbles](http://www.jessamyn.com/journal/03/jul.shtml#24)) and [aaron](http://aaronland.info/weblog) who stopped by Boston today, and conceded to drink some of the city’s [notoriously bad coffee](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/archive/4250), while expounding on RDF, politics, free speech, and art. Small world.
