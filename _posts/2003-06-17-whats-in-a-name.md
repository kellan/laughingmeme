Naming is not one of my gifts, I would never be a good magician (a hedge wizard at best), Adam’s task would have driven me to nervous break down.

So faced with a new laptop I panicked a bit, thrashed, consulted with my family (many of whom do have a gift with names), consulted the [Oxford Shakespeare](http://bartelby.com/70/) for some elf or moonshine demi-puppet, and various sources for an appropriately Unseelie golbinkin. With no success I eventually settled on Capuchin, a name with a varied and amusing etymology and good sound, and I’ve grown fond of it.. Briefly, however, I considered Lightning (as in Stoppard’s “the joke that consoles. My tortoise Lightning, my fiancé Hannah”), it didn’t fit with a shiny new G4, and once, late, in the darkness of the night, in a moment of self insight, I almost named it Mephistopheles.
