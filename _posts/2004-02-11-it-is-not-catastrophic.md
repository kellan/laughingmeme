> Adding Atom support to RSS-consuming applications should be a matter of hours, maybe a day or two of developer time. This whole thing may be annoying, but it is *not catastrophic.*– [Tom](http://tuttlesvc.teacherhosting.com/blog/blosxom.cgi/labor/education/blogging/FudBlast.html "Tuttle SVC")

I think it took about 2-3 hours to code and test Magpie’s (admittedly incomplete) Atom support, plus at least another hour to [blog about it](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001676.html). So call it 4 hours total. (from 11pm to 3am) As for the rest of it, **we can only hope.**

On a side note, Atom is clearly a failure as [Ken MacLeod](http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/) **still** doesn’t have a feed I can subscribe to.
