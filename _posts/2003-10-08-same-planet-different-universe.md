[Aidan’s](http://sedesdraconis.com) [feature](http://sedesdraconis.com/index.cgi?Features) this month is about the how entirely we construct our understanding of the world, and the [difficulty that presents to having rationale dissent](http://sedesdraconis.com/index.cgi?Features/Dissent).

> It’s a positive feedback loop, self-perpetuating condition of division and breakdown of communication. It’s scary. We can add it to the list of other really scary things in the world today. Like, “what are we going to do about Africa?”; and the Plan for a New American Century.
