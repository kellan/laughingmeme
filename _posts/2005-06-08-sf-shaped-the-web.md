I don’t know if its true, but its a neat idea. Someone get [Mike Davis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike\_Davis) on the case!

It is also kind of funny because I think of San Francisco as small, approachable city, that is relatively easy to get around, or to get from one side to the other. (Bay to Breakers anyone?) At least compared to other American cities.
