Played more [Quinn](http://www.stud.tu-ilmenau.de/~siha-in/software.html) (Tetris for OS X) last night. Its been generating some [good](http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2723) [buzz](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/07/DailyMacOSXHint) and I think I know why. Besides being a very nicely done (and pretty) faithful implementation of the addictive original, the author has also realized that Tetris has an aging fan base, and starts off much slower then I remember other Tetris apps doing over the years.

Or maybe Iâ€™ve just gotten better at Tetris in the intervening 8 years since I was last playing it regularily.
