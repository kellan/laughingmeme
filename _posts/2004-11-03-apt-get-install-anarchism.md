The fourth <acronym title="cascadia anarchist tech skillshare">cAts</acronym> will be happening this weekend in Seattle.

Lots of reasons to be excited (VOIP hacking, security for the paranoid, a “Tech n Bitch” session, lots of hacking and show and tell, vegetarain meals, and home roasting skill share assuming we can find some green coffee beans)

But right now I’m most excited by the shirts we’ve printed up.

We’ll probably be distributing most of them this weekend, but if do want one, let me know and I’ll try to save you one. Printing costs were $11 (damn, expensive American Apparel shirts), and we’re hoping to sell them in the $15-$20 range with anything remotely resembling a profit going towards the Seattle Underground Colo (nee [SeaCCP](http://seaccp.org/))

Alas, the [Vote with Rocks](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002425.html) shirts weren’t printed in time. Still I hope you all did your part.
