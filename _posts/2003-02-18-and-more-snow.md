We *only* got a little over 2 feet yesterday, about an average of 3 inches an hour, but the winds, the winds, they did amazing things. Looking into the backyard this morning, there are 8 foot snow drifts piled against fences, and what might have once been cars. A good day not to own a car.

So next time, before it gets all nasty, icy, and gray, pictures!)
