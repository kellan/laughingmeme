[Brian](http://hybernaut.com/), [Rod](http://groovymother.com/), and [glenn](http://www.furia.com/) have launched the [Boston Web Technology Forum](http://bostonwtf.com/), a group blog documenting (and hopefully instigating) innovation in the local Boston web scene.

Their [initial article is on the relaunch](http://bostonwtf.com/kiko-2.0) of Ajax calendar startup [Kiko](http://kiko.com) (the original!), and how its new features stack up against [30Boxes](http://30boxes.net) (the contender). Biggie vs. Tupac style.

Looks promising, Brian’s coverage is deeper then the Techcrunch patented drive-by review, and Rod in particular brings the biting insight which is shaping up to be the UK most successful 21st export.

The topic being calendaring I couldn’t resist going all pundity in the comments.
