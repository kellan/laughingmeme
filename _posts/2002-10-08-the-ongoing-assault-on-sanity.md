What does it mean to force workers back to work who got locked out? I have this image of the Longshoremen being squished through the chain link fences of the Oakland docks like dough from a cookie press, or cheese through a grater. ### Everything you know is wong

- Its not a strike
- The Longshoremen aren’t opposed to technology
- ILWU has specifically said it would like expedite any shipments concerning national security but can’t get back on the docks
- The best way to have a mediation is not for the management to show up to it armed.
