[MagpieRSS 0.5.1](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55691&release_id=165249) is out with a fix for the [gzip silent failure bug](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000811.html) that showed up when attempting to fetch an RSS file with gzip encoding when PHP had been built without zlib support. Also include random other small clean up.

Btw, that also means Magpie now runs on OS Xâ€™s stock Apache/PHP.
