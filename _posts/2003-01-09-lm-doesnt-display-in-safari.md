Apparently the left hand bar [isn’t displaying properly in Safari](http://www.osxgoodies.com/node.php?id=22 "World's largest distributed QA session continues with more good info from OSX Goodies"). Considering my disoriented state right now (new house, yeh!) Apple will probably fix the problem before I do (**update**: hyatt [might have a fix](http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/2003_01_05_mozillian_archive.html#90166083))

In the meantime, you are missing out on such fascinating features as, “What Am I Reading?”, “Where Am I?”, and “Which Sites I Read Recently Published!”.

While we’re talking about Safari, an interesting thread on how [Apple’s KWQ (‘Quack’) technology might allow Konq/Safari to be ported to Windows](http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&m=104205219114244&w=2).
