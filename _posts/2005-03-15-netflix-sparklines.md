Like many geeks I secretly covet [Tufte’s](http://www.edwardtufte.com) serenely assured design sense, and fetishize his pronouncements. That said, most [sparkline](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg*id=0001Eb&amp;topic*id=1) implementations I’ve seen have left me confused. The [sparklines](http://bumppo.net/archives/2005/03/index.html#000454) that [Nat](http://bumppo.net) is generating of Netflix rental data are different. They’re great. Great in the sense that they’re small, and trivial, communicate exactly what they’re supposed to do.

Looking at my last 16 months ![](/img/netflix-sparkline.png) of rental history , you can see that I almost always spend on an average more per movie then I would have at the corner video store ($3/video). Either I’m a sucker, or am I getting some other value out of it. Either way, that itty bitty graph packs an amazing amount of info in.

And he’s got a service setup where you can [generate your own](http://bumppo.net/projects/netflix/).
