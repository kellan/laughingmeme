If I had time to be reading the Net right now I would read, [Smart Contracts: Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks](http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_9/szabo/), maybe someone could read it and summarize it for me?

Would also be reading Paul Prescond’s, [Why REST Doesn’t Have a Data Encoding](http://www.prescod.net/rest/encoding/).

Quick check-in: In Providence, reading Morrow’s *Towing Jehovah*, doing **lots** of writing/thinking about “open editing”, as discussed by [Dru](http://dru.ca/imc/open_pub.html) and [Maff](http://www.cat.org.au/maffew/cat/openedit.html).
