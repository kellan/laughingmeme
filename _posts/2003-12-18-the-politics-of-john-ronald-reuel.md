People are reporting back this evening, and reports are positive, with the slight caveat that “everyone was crying at the end”. I am not allowed to see Return of the King until Christmas so I’m avoiding reading or thinking too much about it.

However a few people are taking this renewed interest to decode the subtexts and politics of Tolkien’s work.

### To The Victors Go the Book Contracts

David Brin (in the fine tradition of his [politicized readings of Star Wars](http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_main/ "Why is George Lucas peddling an elitist, anti-democratic agenda under the guise of escapist fun?")) has written [J.R.R. Tolkien — enemy of progress](http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/index.html): > May I offer a final little mind-stretching exercise? Let’s start by remembering that history is written by the victors…Well, LOTR is obviously an account written after the Ring War ended, long ago. Right? An account created by the victors.

### The Ring of Free Trade

Another amusing explication is this [short remix](http://sf.indymedia.org/uploads/ringoffreetrade.mov) of Fellowship, spookily interpreted into a treatise on corporate globalization. (by [passionbomb](http://passionbomb.com/)) I have to say I never though of Black Blockers as marching rank and file, but if dwarves had survived the ending of the Third Age you **know** they’d be the backbone of Labor, and Noam has never looked so good.
