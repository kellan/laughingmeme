While Erik suffers from tagging indecision over the every critical \[“how do I tag lunch?”\](http://erikbenson.typepad.com/mu/2005/07/tag*me*conflict.html) question, I suffer from a more prosaic question, how do I tag music?

\[MusicBrainz\](http://musicbrainz.org/) could really distinguish itself, if it could provide a commons where I could tag/discover music metadata like the rich mood/genre info you can find from \[AllMusic\](http://www.allmusic.com/).

Anyone have a solution for me? In particular a solution that doesn’t involve me having to tag all my music myself?

Because I could really use a playlist of music this morning tagged “lush electronic romantic”, you know?
