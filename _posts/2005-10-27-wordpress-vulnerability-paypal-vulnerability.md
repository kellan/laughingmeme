Someone seems to have successfully modified the content of a post on the \[Wordpress\](http://wordpress.org) powered \[Magpie blog\](http://magpie.laughingmeme.org/blog/) to insert link spam into the content of an existing post. Is there a known vulnerability that allows this? I admit I’ve been remiss in following WordPress security advisories?

Interestingly only one post has been altered, and that post has the distinction of being the post with an embedded \[Paypal\](http://paypal.com) donation button.

I’ve yanked the blog down for now until I have time to figure out what happened. (and I just got <acronym title="Laughing Meme">LM</acronym> back online)
