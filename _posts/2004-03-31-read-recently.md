I\\\\\\'ve got a soft spot for popularized history that take in the whole sweeping scope of human history (see Jared Diamond), the subject matter is intriguing (oil mining rigs were invented for mining salt; Imperial England\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\"War on Drugs\\\\\\\" was a war on salt, and Gandhi\\\\\\'s great march to the sea was to collect salt in the traditional manner; those pink ponds near SFO *are* salt ponds, and consequently are pink for the same reason flamingos are, brine shrimp), and the writing is solid.

I also found some of the characters problematic, but we decided that we\\\\\\'re seeing the world through the tinted glasses of our narrating television producer in which everything is larger, and louder, like stage makeup.

The language is <cite>Pattern Recognition</cite> sings, each sentence has the a hand crafted quality, not a folksy crafts quality, put a piece of machinery, so expertly built the seams disappear, and then detailed and polished to perfection.  More interesting still is how Gibson uses the tools of science fiction to invert its standard role.  The key to crafting a scifi world is to normalize it to the point that a drama can play out against this future fantastic landscape.  Good writers do this through the description of daily life, letting the big picture coded into the spin its puts on each small detail.

She is also a world traveller with some of the most cutting and insightful commentary on travel I\\\\\\'ve ever read.  I find it disappointing that her inner turmoil, with its subtle hints of anger and self-loathing (see Evan Hatch) is expressed/suppressed through clothes, shopping, and helplessness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlso the brand saturation which gives the works its authentically now-ness is going to age very poorly I imagine, so read it soon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\\\\\\\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765303795/\\\\\\\"><cite>Appleseed</cite></a> - <a href=\\\\\\\"http://www.johnclute.co.uk/\\\\\\\">John Clute</a> - Clute\\\\\\'s reviews are the stuff of legend, once Bloom shuffles off, maybe they can hire Clute to update <cite>Western Canon</cite> into something slightly less moribund.

[Dru](http://misnomer.dru.ca) and [Josh](http://unreasonables.org) have a nasty habit of making me feel unread, whie Lattice (who conveniently doesn’t have a blog) questions my taste in books. Still Dru has a [nice list of his recent readings](http://misnomer.dru.ca/2004/03/recent_books.html), and presumably [Rabble](http://anarchogeek.com) is going to post one one of these days, and I said I was going to do that [50 book thing](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001714.html#001714), so here are my recent reads. Probably missed a few (beyond my perennial re-reads), that I’ll think of later. (nudge me, if you remember me mentioning something I forgot to list)

[<cite>Midnight Robber</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446675601/) – [Nalo Hopkinson ](http://www.sff.net/people/nalo/) – <cite>Brown Girl in the Ring</cite> was awesome: compelling, genre smashing, enjoyable, good storytelling. <cite>Midnight Robber</cite> borrows the Caribbean sensibility of Brown Girl, and mixes it with a not so compelling 70s scifi retread. Still I’m excited about <cite>Salt Road</cite>

[<cite>Salt</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142001619/) – [Mark Kurlansky](http://www.saltbook.com/author.php) – for Kurlansky the history of the world is the history of salt (before that it was salted cod, and before that it was the salted cod fishermen, the Basque). I’ve got a soft spot for popularized history that take in the whole sweeping scope of human history (see Jared Diamond), the subject matter is intriguing (oil mining rigs were invented for mining salt; Imperial England’s “War on Drugs” was a war on salt, and Gandhi’s great march to the sea was to collect salt in the traditional manner; those pink ponds near SFO *are* salt ponds, and consequently are pink for the same reason flamingos are, brine shrimp), and the writing is solid. However Mark clearly read *a lot* of old cookbooks, and the flow can get bogged down by his need to share this or that Roman culinary tip.

[<cite>My Year of Meats</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140280464/) – [Ruth Ozeki](http://www.ruthozeki.com/) – recommended by a friend, I read the first 20 pages at the bookstore, and decided it was coming home with me based on a phone sex scene that was authentic, and funny, and so endearingly unromantic, that it was romantic again. However I had a hard time to engaging with the central themes of meat, pregnancy, and Walmart; as a vegetarian, with little to no exposure to Walmart, and as a man with no intentions of starting a family soon. I also found some of the characters problematic, but we decided that we’re seeing the world through the tinted glasses of our narrating television producer in which everything is larger, and louder, like stage makeup. The writing is tight but breezy, and our narrator engaging.

[<cite>Pattern Recognition</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425192938/) – [William Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp) – Gibson is back.

She is also a world traveller with some of the most cutting and insightful commentary on travel I’ve ever read. I find it disappointing that her inner turmoil, with its subtle hints of anger and self-loathing (see Evan Hatch) is expressed/suppressed through clothes, shopping, and helplessness.

Also the brand saturation which gives the works its authentically now-ness is going to age very poorly I imagine, so read it soon.

[<cite>Appleseed</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765303795/) – [John Clute](http://www.johnclute.co.uk/) – Clute’s reviews are the stuff of legend, once Bloom shuffles off, maybe they can hire Clute to update <cite>Western Canon</cite> into something slightly less moribund.

And it was on the bargain table today, so I picked it up. Didn’t get very far into it before switching back to Kapla Imperial.

[<cite>Dubliners</cite> ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140186476/) – [James Joyce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce) – its trite to love Joyce, but I love Joyce.

[<cite>Angels in America (Part I and II)</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1559360615/) – [Tony Kushner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kushner) – I missed the recent Seattle production of <cite>Homebody/Kabul</cite> (a fact about which I am supremely disappointed), and I didn’t catch HBO’s <cite>Angels</cite> due to a lack of a TV.

[<cite>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679775439/) – [Murakami Haruki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murakami_Haruki) – I’ve been trying for a month to think of what to say about this book, without much luck.

[<cite>Age of Extremes</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679730052/) – Eric Hobsbawm – “A History of the World, 1914-1991”. Excellent, clear, convincing attempt to understand the “short 20th century” (WWI to the fall of the USSR), and collapse of 19th century civil society and liberalism. I’m in the “inter war” period right now.

[<cite>Assasian’s</cite>](http://www.sfsite.com/04a/ques30.htm) and <cite>Fool’s</cite> – [Robin Hobb](http://www.robinhobb.com/) – Hobb makes a virtue out of high fantasy, simple sentences, and melodrama.

Blah.

[<cite>New Media: 1740-1915</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262072459/) – Various – Opened strong with the work on zograscopes (would you believe my spell checker doesn’t know that word?); examining both their relationship with the media of the their day, and their role in perpetuating the sort of isolating, and cleansed virtual reality the Net is accused of today.

[<cite>The State of the Art</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0929480066/) – [Iain M. Banks](http://www.iainbanks.net/) – short stories, plus a [Culture](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~stefan/culture.html) novella. I prefer him at novel length.

[<cite>Station of the Tide</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380730456/) – [Michael Swanwick](www.michaelswanwick.com/) – worth it for lines like, “Startled, a clutch of acorn-mimetic octopi dropped from a low branch, brown circles of water fleeting as they jetted into the silt”.
