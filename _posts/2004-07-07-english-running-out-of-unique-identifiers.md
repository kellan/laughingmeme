In my [continuing](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002142.html#002142) [series](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000272.html) looking at Apple’s appropriation of other people’s codenames, does anyone else think [Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html), has some real similarities to [Dashboard](http://www.nat.org/dashboard/).
