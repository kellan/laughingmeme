Meant to blog something about listening to the [Strasbourg No Borders](http://www.noborder.org/strasbourg/index.php) camp radio, but that was last week, time slips away.

A [good report back](http://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0207/msg00185.html) about the camp was posted to `nettime-l`.

> The “No Border” camps (like the one at Strasbourg) are events that grow out of the activities of the No Border Network, (www.noborder.org) an alliance of activists and organizations engaged in campaigning against tightening border controls, increasing persecution of emigrants and border crossers, and the buidling up of what can be best described as the “Fortress Europe/Australia/America” phenomenon.

<div align="right">[via anarchogeek](http://www.anarchogeek.com)</div>The next major No Border activity in North America, will be [borderhack](http://borderhack.org), Aug 16th-18th. Not much info on their website yet, accept “Show Up”, hopefully that will change soon.

Why are the europeans so much better at getting artists involved in the movement? Take a look at these awesome banner adds from Strasbourg.
