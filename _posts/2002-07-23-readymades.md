Listening to [Chumbawamba’s Readymades](http://www.chumba.com/_readymades.htm), its wonderful! A very different sound then their earlier albums, I didn’t realize who it was at first, definitely taking a pop influence, and messing with it.

> It is a great thing that we have an unarmed police force in this country. It is perhaps an even greater thing that an unarmed police force manages to shot and kill so many people.

Right now, at the end of a crappy day, I’ve got “Home with Me” on repeat play.
