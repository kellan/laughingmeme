There has been a lot of focus on the RNC for September, but there are a number of fun activities kicking off in Boston this week. And as I couldn’t find most of this information on the Web, but as a fair amount of it arrives in my inbox, I thought I’d pass it along.

This weekend (July 23-25) is the [Boston Social Forum](http://www.bostonsocialforum.org/news.php), there are supposed to over 600 tracks, it looks a little disorganized, several look interesting, “Beyond Oil” Saturday night at UMass-Boston, and Billy Bragg at the [Middle East](http://www.mideastclub.com/), also Saturday night ($30!). See the [full schedule](http://www.bostonsocialforum.org/e107_plugins/survey/view.php?1.)

[Black Tea Society](http://blackteasociety.org/index.php), will be opening the [covergence space](http://www.blackteasociety.org/convergence_center.php) at [Community Church](http://www.commchurch.org/) (site of BioDev2000, and the original Boston IMC) Sunday night. If you’re coming into town to do [Indymedia](http://boston.indymedia.org) work, stop by the IMC desk and get your IMC press pass (small donation requested if you want a photo ID). Won’t get you into the Fleet Center, but it will get you into the [TecsChange](http://www.tecschange.org/), and [CCTV](http://www.cctvcambridge.org/) facilities.

There are a couple of different calendars for the following week: [here](http://www.blackteasociety.org/calendar.php), [here](http://www.protest.net/DNCevents/calendrome.cgi), and [here](http://www.unitedprogressivealliance.org/cal-dnc-a.htm).

That should get you through the weekend, as always, stop by the convergence center once its open for how to get involved, and latest info.

And under **no circumstances** enter the death trap under North Station being referred to as a “Free Speech Zone”. ([photos](http://boston.indymedia.org/newswire/display/23765/index.php))
