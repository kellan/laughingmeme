So I wrote up my own little SOAP client to [Allconsuming](http://allconsuming.net), which, while not nearly as cool as [booktalk](http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/2003/01/20#allconsuming), works nicely to maintain my little READING sidebar. (though as you can see in the case of <cite>Applying Patterns</cite> there are still some aesthetic tweaks to make). Get the [script](/code/allconsuming_pl.txt) and the [template](/code/allconsuming.tmpl).

By the way, it looks a little different then DJ’s because [SOAP::Lite’s](http://www.soaplite.com) `autodispatch+` feature [breaks Template Toolkit](http://lists.ourshack.com/pipermail/templates/2003-January/004191.html) (and is kind of icky anyway)
