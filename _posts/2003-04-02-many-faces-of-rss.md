[The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/) announced they finally have [a valid RSS feed](http://www.theregister.co.uk/tonys/slashdot.rdf), RSS 1.0, Microsoft also announced that MSDN now have a whole [slew of new RSS feeds](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald/default.aspx#nn2003-04-01T06:03:44Z), RSS 2.0. That sounds about right.

Could be worse, sounds like [Sun choose](http://zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=32&ItemID=3193) the other <acronym title="Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh">RSS</acronym>
