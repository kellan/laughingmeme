I feel like I should write something grand, sweeping and subversive with a title like that. However it just means that upon picking up a bookshelf at a yard sale today, I’m impulsively picked up a copy of AoE II. I’m not sure why, as the only video games I seem to play these days is [Quinn](http://www.stud.tu-ilmenau.de/~siha-in/software.html), the loving reproduction of Tetris for OS X, and [robotfindskitten](http://www.robotfindskitten.org/). Is it worth getting into? Is it dangerous to get into?
