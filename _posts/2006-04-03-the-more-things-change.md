Corporate culture is a funny thing, certain ideas get ingrained, others get discarded, practices are repeated forever even after everyone who remembers why they were put in places have been laid off, or cashed out.

But what I can’t understand is why, *dear god why*, Palm, ostensibly a company with calendaring as a core competency, has never in its long history been able to get timezones right. Several operating systems (not to mention web properties) later, they’re *still* \[screwing them up\](http://www.everythingtreo.com/news/hardware/palm-treo-700w-has-daylight-savings-time-bug-20060402249/).

I remember sitting in a conversation at Anyday post-acquisition discussing whether we should break timezone support to make it work work like Palm Desktop.
