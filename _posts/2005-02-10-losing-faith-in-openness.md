Or perhaps feeling as if I don’t entirely understand it. Two recent experiments one I participated in, and one observed in being open about things which are traditionally secret seem to be paying off poorly.

The first was the decision by [Groundspring][gs] to post our [design][screen] and [spec documents][spec] for our [“community relationship management”][ent] tool to the public as we were building them. The idea was that this would engage people in a discussion of which features were meaningful to the organization. In fact what it did was make it very simple for a me too project to slap together a very similar sounding spec followed by a mail blast to every relevant tech mailing list asking for feedback on their new spec.

The second is [Robot Co-op’s](http://robotcoop.com/) decision to [disclose their relationship with Amazon](http://robotcoop.com/weblog/52/on-background) which rather then quieting down the [conspiracy theorist](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2005/02/08/43/) seems to have brought them out of the wood work with demands for even more disclosure.

I’ve done some thinking about how a different space for dialogue might have been created for the first experiment, but I think largely we’re still dealing with a culture that isn’t really trained to engage in dialogue, and responds much better to being rebuffed, fed press releases, and kept in the dark.
