7 posts about OS X, 3 in 2 days, and I don’t even own a Mac. (actually I do, maybe I need exhume, my old Blue &amp; White G3). I’m totally craving a new iBook, to replace the Vaio/Debian combo I’m writing this from.

[randomWalks](http://randomwalks.com) has an article on how to use [cvs from within BBEdit 6.5](http://xspot.randomwalks.com/discuss/85261272/2002_07_01_xspot_archive.php), and not just CVS, but CVS over SSH! I spent 2.5 years coding perl CGIs in BBEdit, and manually SCPing the files up and down, and using BBEdit’s wonderful diff function to do source control. At times I miss that diff screen, best I ever used, but it still wasn’t CVS. **update:** that link no longer seems to work, try [Bare Bones CVS FAQ](http://www.barebones.com/support/faq/faq.php?action=category&minor_id=3) or Apple’s [OS X: Version Control with CVS](http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/cvsoverview.html).
