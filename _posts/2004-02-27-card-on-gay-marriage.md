> The dark secret of homosexual society — the one that dares not speak its name — is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally. – [Orson Scott Card](http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-15-1.html)

To [paraphrase Card](http://www.nauvoo.com/library/hypocrites-osc.html) I don’t advocate, or encourage harsh personal treatment (say disenfranchisement) of individuals who are unable to resist the temptation towards [fundamentalism, biological empiricism and religious extremism](http://www.nauvoo.com/library/hypocrites-osc.html). As long as they are struggling to overcome their temptation.

He does however put forth the one point I can genuinely understand maybe has the conservatives spooked.

> Men, after all, know what men like far better than women do; women know how women think and feel far better than men do.

I wonder if deep down its about the conservative’s fear that their wives and husbands will abandon them?

Turns out [Kinsley prediction](http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/archives/002828.html) was right. It clearly has gotten ugly, and its starting to get boring.

In other news [religion and celibacy aren’t looking so good](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,1282,-3797254,00.html). Perhaps people should focus on getting their own houses in order?
