Having played with and thought about the costs associated with handling transactions and paying people (and we’re talking monetary|infrastructural costs, not social|spiritual, thats a different post), I’m always struck by how much overhead there is; overhead in fact swamping the value of many types of transaction.

Which is how I know I’m living in 21st century when I was able to \[buy David Brin’s latest work\](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOU4RQ/ref=pd*rvi*gw\_1/104-5382767-0831115?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=551440), with money I made \[filling in phone number information on a couple SF restaurant listing\](http://www.mturk.com/), and have enough left over to cover \[backing up\](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/104-5382767-0831115?node=16427261) the contents of my \[virtual server\](http://www.johncompanies.com/) I just flashed.

No real insight but having just lived through it, it felt worth noting.
