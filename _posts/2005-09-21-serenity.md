I’m not sure yet if we’ll be in Boston or New York on the 30th, but I know what I’m doing … watching [Serenity](http://www.serenitymovie.com/nonflash\_site/crew.html)! (not, unfortunately, Santa Cruz as originally planned)

Any movie going parties forming in either city? Looking to add 1 fan, and 1 skeptic to the mix?

Oh my! I had forgotten that was out there, Henson, Gaiman and McKean. (I wonder what ever happened to [Gaiman/Froud Tam-lin project](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000867.html)?
