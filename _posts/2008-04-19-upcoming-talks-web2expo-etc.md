I’m speaking next Friday at the \[SF Web2Expo\](http://sf.web2expo.com) on \[Casual Privacy\](http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/1826). I’m speaking in Dublin Speaking Thursday May 8th (2 weeks later) in Dublin on \[Advanced OAuth Wrangling\](http://2008.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/645). Hope to see you at one or both of those talks.

I’m also excited about a \[dozen other talks next week\](http://webexsf2008.crowdvine.com/profiles/1841/talks), as you can see from my \[Web2/iCalico schedule\](http://webexsf2008.crowdvine.com/profiles/1841/talks).
