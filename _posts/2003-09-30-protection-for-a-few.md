Much is being made about reporters obligation to protect their confidential sources, the “two senior administration officals”, in the [Valerie Plame case](http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1052798,00.html). Which makes the Register’s story that the [Department of Justice has started subpoenaing journalists under the USA-PATRIOT act](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/33106.html) (via [steve](http://saladwithsteve.com)) just that much more intersting. A double standard?
