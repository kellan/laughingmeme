Still frustrated and disappointed that \[MeasureMap\](http://measuremap.com) has gone away, even if it never went as \[far as I wanted it to go\](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2005/11/22/measuremap-alpha-review).

Finally got around to trying out \[Google Analytics\](http://www.google.com/analytics/), maybe I’m doing it wrong, but I’m bored by it. Doesn’t answer \[the questions I’m interested in\](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2005/11/22/measuremap-alpha-review), though it did flag the interesting statistic that 94% of my visitors are “first time visitors”, which I imagine could also be dubbed the “I’ve got full content feeds” usage profile.

I guess I try \[Mint\](http://haveamint.com) next, though the demos don’t look like a lot more then a (very) pretty face on my old \[analog\](http://www.analog.cx/) install, and $30 seems a bit much to pay for that. And really I think stats for blogs need a domain specific package. But there seems to be an active plugin community around Mint which is promising.

Sigh.

**update:** Checked back today, it’s interesting to note that with a few more days of data IE’s percentage has already fallen from 42% to 37.6%. Maybe it wil fall to a 1/3? I, for one, have never believed that 95% market share number folks like to throw around.
