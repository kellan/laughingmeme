So add a number to the end of it.  Works great with AOL and Hotmail.  Why didn\\'t we think of that with the template modules, I can just image Template83.pm hitting CPAN, and then people get tired of big numbers and we start seeing things like TemplateKitty9.pm\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the upside the author of NaiveBayes1 does what so very few people do, documents why he needed a new module over the one on CPAN.

Just noticed [AI::NaiveBayes**1**](http://search.cpan.org/author/VLADO/AI-NaiveBayes1-0.02/) on CPAN. The name you want is taken? So add a number to the end of it. Works great with AOL and Hotmail. Why didnâ€™t we think of that with the template modules, I can just image Template83.pm hitting CPAN, and then people get tired of big numbers and we start seeing things like TemplateKitty9.pm

On the upside the author of NaiveBayes1 does what so very few people do, documents why he needed a new module over the one on CPAN. So points for that.
