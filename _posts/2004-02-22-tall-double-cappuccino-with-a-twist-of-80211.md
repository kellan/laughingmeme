[Seattle Wifi-Mug](http://seattle.wifimug.org) has reached 40 assorted cafes, teahouses, pizza parlors, and other sundry locales that serve free wireless alongside their wares. (a few active contributors have done a *great* job of fleshing out the site)

[UZ](http://seattle.wifimug.org/?UZ) the first coffee shop I’ve ever been in that feels like it was designed to be a wireless coffee shop from day one, recently opened. Replete with plentiful power outlets, 802.11g, and great coffee, its a new thing. Also “the Ave” is finally getting free wireless. [Trabant Chai Lounge](http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?TrabantChaiLounge) was the first, but in response [Ginkgo Tea](http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?GinkgoTea), my favorite place to get bubble tea is no longer charging for their access.

[Comfrey](http://jeff.comfrey.net) wanted to launch [Portland Wifi-Mug](http://pdx.wifimug.org), but [got distracted](http://jeff.comfrey.net/archives/000008.html) before I could set it up for him. And if anyone wants to start Boston Wifi-Mug, you’ve got the [excellent Junebug](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001368.html#001368), [Trident Booksellers &amp; Cafe](http://www.tridentbookscafe.com/), and the [Espresso Royale](http://www.espresso-royale.com/locations_detail.cfm?state=Massachusetts) near <acronym title="Northeastern University">NEU</acronym> recently stopped charging.
