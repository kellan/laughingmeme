Actually what the [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2856647.stm) says is:

> UN weapons inspectors say they have been warned by the United States to start leaving Iraq in what is seen as the clearest sign yet that war is imminent.

But I wonder if anyone will remember that in 5 years? Or will history be rewritten, [again](http://www.fair.org/extra/0210/inspectors.html)?
