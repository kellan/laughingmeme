Etel started this morning, so if this the first you’re hearing of it, you’re too late to check the [RAGI: Ruby on Rails with Asterisk talk](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/etel2006/view/e*sess/8105), but not too late to check [Evan](http://anarchogeek.com) and [Blaine’s](http://romeda.org/) [Phone Communities and Activism Showcase](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/etel2006/view/e*sess/8157) (you might have seen the preview at Foocamp), or [Tad’s](http://web.media.mit.edu/~tad/) [Speakeasy: Using Open Source to Overcome Barriers and Promote Community Development in an Immigrant Neighborhood](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/etel2006/view/e\_sess/8156). Conveniently they’re back to back Thursday afternoon.
