The worst part of flying back and forth between Seattle and Boston on a regular basis is you end up consuming a year’s supply of light reading in just a few months.

Removed from the pool of viable future brain candy during last week’s 6,000 mile jaunt: <style>

- [Kristine Smith: Contact Imminent](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0060503580) – not as strong as [the original 3](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001449.html). I want more paper system!
- [Patricia McKillip – Ombria in Shadow](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0441010164) – lush, exquisite, fantasy that has never heard of Tolkien or “The Quest”. Ombria is city of doors, a tradition that extends back through DiTerlizzi and Calvino, all the way back to Marco Polo. (and probably beyond) Recommended.
- [Spidering Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/) – Excellent, entertaining, informative even to an old spidering hack like me.
- [Dorthy Sayers: Gaudy Nights](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0061043494) – a classic. Fans of Bujold should read Sayers, especially <cite>Gaudy Nights</cite>.
- [Elizabeth Moon: Remnant Population](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=034546219X) – Moon channeling Le Guin. Entertaining once you get past the overwhelming wise old woman parable. Aliens operate on modified consensus.
- [Patrick O’Brian: Master &amp; Commander](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0393307050) – soporific, perhaps the ideal characteristic of in flight reading? I try to read O’Brian every year or so, can’t stay awake.
