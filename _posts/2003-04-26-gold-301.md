Wow, I just got a hit with the useragent `Mozilla/3.01Gold (Macintosh; I; 68K)`, and unlike half the hits I get claiming to be IE, it looked like a browser. (grabbed images, clicked slowly).

I remember Netscape 3.01 Gold, must have been Fall of ’96 it came out, it was a revoluntionary browser in its time though nothing like the shakeup earlier version were, Netscape 3 was the browser that brought tables smart enough to use for layout tricks, font face, and table background colors, a designers browser, but I can’t imagine what the web must look like using it these days. Can you even get those old browsers anymore?
