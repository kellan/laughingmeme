The New York Times does itself proud with a 15 page clear, and articulate piece of reporting [examining the “aluminum tubes for uranium centrifuges” issue](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/international/middleeast/03tube.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5090&en=2e1cdcc5b66e0332&ex=1254456000&partner=rssuserland), which David Kay referred to as

> “the only piece of physical evidence about the Iraqi weapons programs that they (we) had.”

**update:**Turns out it **was** [rocket science](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001521.html). (via [les](http://decafbad.com/))
