### Scams as class warfare?

Teresa: “[scams take the forms they do because they’re parodies–no, a better way to put it: they’re cargo-cult effigies–of the deals the ruling class cut for themselves.](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/2002_10.html#001509)“, on how and why scams work. ### Perl behind the curtain

Abhijit: [`sub perlhash { $hash = 0;  foreach (split //, shift) { $hash = $hash*33 + ord($_);  return $hash; }`](http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/2002/10/01/hashes.html), on how and why Perl hashes work. ![:)](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png) No more just taking them for granted. The only time I’ve ever felt insecure about using Perl was a when a C programming friend was riffing on how he could never be happy with mass produced hashes, and insisted on rolling his own.
