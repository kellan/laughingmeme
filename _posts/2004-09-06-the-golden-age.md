If John C. Wright accomplished nothing else, with [<cite>The Golden Age</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812579844/), except construct a universe in which the following exchange was sensical and relevant, he would have achieved a major coup

> “Do you see him?”  
> “No, mistress. But I see a fat man dressed as Polonious. Unless I miss my guess that is the segment of me with Phaethon.”  
> “But it doesn’t look like you…”  
> “Ah, but look at where his robes touch the grass.”  
> “Webbed feet?”  
> “Any man with penguin feet must be me! I’d recognize myself anywhere. Should I blast him with my heat ray?”

However he does so much more.  
I also liked this little exchange when our viewpoint character discovers his privacy has been invaded

> “How dare you monitor my brain activity without permission?! Have you no concern for privacy?”  
> “The privacy curtain was not in use. Kirlian auras and chakra-energy broadcasts are visible.”  
> “Not in the real world. No such sense perception exists.”  
> “Aura-reading sense perceptions are allowed by the Revised Aesthetic Standard. You prefer the Consensus Aesthetic? Apologies are rendered.”

Not quite sure how he is going to keep it going for 3 books, but Wright definitely (not to mention defiantly) proves that it’s possible to write compelling post-Singularity fiction.
