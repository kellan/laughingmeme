“I’ve never been one to keep a journal (much to my chagrin as an inveterate collector of fancy stationery), but, silly as it may sound, Twitter made me feel like a field correspondent—our man on the Rio Grande—and thus encouraged me to think like a journalist.” – [Buzz](http://log.scifihifi.com/post/8315602718/twitter-instagram-and-the-journalistic-impulse).
