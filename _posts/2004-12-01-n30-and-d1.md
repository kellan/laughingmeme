Some people seemed to get excited about yesterday, something about it being the 5 year anniversary of the [launching of Indymedia](http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002422.html#002422) (see [John Tarletonâ€™s work](http://www.johntarleton.net/#wto) for a survey of that heady first year) and the [launching of a (white) radical public identity in the US](http://unreasonables.org/node/view/124). Important stuff.

But we all know that the real importance of November 30th is that today is December 1st, which means the first day of the [Perl Advent Calendar](http://perladvent.org/2004/), which kicks off with one of my favorite modules, [DateTime](http://perladvent.org/2004/1st/).
