Grabbed an early dinner at Tamarind Bay this Sunday. It was as good as \[promised\](http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/food\_drink/dining/documents/04122412.asp), really excellent, richly seasoned, interesting takes on traditional Indian fare, and cheaper then expected. Get the Lalla mussa dal. And the interior design got Jasmine’s stamp of approval.

Walking across Winthrop Square, I also visited \[Upstairs on the Square\](http://www.upstairsonthesquare.com/index.php) last week. As a \[party of 8\](http://del.icio.us/kellan/techdinner) we had the veranda to ourselves, which I recommend if you can swing it. Upstairs was also as good as promised (get egg custard appetizer), though rather more expensive then expected. (might have been the 5 bottles of wine).

5 bottles which while quite good, I didn’t enjoy as much as we’ve lately been enjoying the Stone Hedge 2002 Chardonnay from TJ’s.

Equally surprising, has been the discovery of Turtle Island Tofurky Italian Sausage. Never a big fan of tofurky, we’ve been branching out into more fake meats in an effort to raise our protein to calories ratio, and happy to find the Tofurky Italian Sausage is excellent. (in that it is flavorful, chewing, spicy, satisfying, and doesn’t actually taste like any known form of meat)

I’d say, and now back to your regularily scheduled technology/programming blogging, but I’d probably be lying.
