Just started reading [blogaritaville](http://scriban.com/) on [cory’s](http://boingboing.net) reccomendation.

### Mission Accomplished

CARP’s new webcasting ruling, which has already killed off a large number of independent webcasters, is based on the model of Broadcast.com. A model which, according to its former CEO was [designed as a scorched-earth policy to starve smaller, less-well-funded webcasters of revenue. ](http://scriban.com/movabletype_archives/000319.shtml#000319)(paraphrase).  
### License to Hack

Much like 007’s extra-legal License to Kill [California Democrat Rep Howard Berman is disucssing legislation to allow the corporate media conglomerates (aka Big Content) to hack system they deem infringe on their copyright.](http://scriban.com/movabletype_archives/000320.shtml) How ones squares this with the DMCA I can’t imagine.
