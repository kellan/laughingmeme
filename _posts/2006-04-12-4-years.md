Leonard’s recent post, [More than a Stopgap](http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4071) got me thinking about my original goals for re-launching this site. Similarly I was wanting to experiment with ways to expose, and explore the 4 years and 3319 entries that compose this site.

### 4 Years

4 years ago Monday, we had just moved out of our apartment in SF having moved to the city at the worst possible time to try to find jobs, Jasmine was back East lining up a design job in Boston, and I had just gotten back from a walk on one of my beloved Santa Cruz beaches, and decided that writing about it would make a good [first blog entry](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2002/04/10/morning-on-the-beach).)

### Plans

Some of the work on adding tags (and [tag combos](http://laughingmeme.org/tag/tagging+social)), and related entries (see middle-right column when viewing an entry) was an initial attempt, as was the [Zeitgeist-esque archives page](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/archives). But I never really was able to take it as far as I wanted. Why?

1. Insufficient time to implement grandiose schemes
2. Changes I made were invisible to aggregators, and therefore most people have never seem them
3. No one else is as interested in my old content as I am

But I still thinks it’s an interesting an unsolved problem. Google is not always the best entry point to the world’s knowledge, chronologically new-new-new is perhaps not the best way to tell our personal stories.

### From the Archives

Just found a post calling for a [repository of community patterns](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2002/04/22/community-software-patterns-and-stripping-javascript) from April 2002 similar to Clay’s [Moderation Strategies](http://social.itp.nyu.edu/shirky/wiki/).
