The [Nudes Adrift Portfolio](http://www.dinaburgarts.com/spencertunick.html) is available for preview online. A more refined piece, to accompany the working notes, and rough sketches that Nerve published over the last year, as [Nudes Adrift Journal](http://www.nerve.com/nudeadrift)

I mention this as [“spencer tunick”](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/cat_spencer_tunick.html) is by far the most popular search term for finding me, even though [Google is currently sending people](http://www.google.com/search?q=spencer+tunick+site%3Alaughingmeme.org) to an entry on [aspect oriented programming](http://www.laughingmeme.org/archives/000045.html) when they find me.

Also, I’m flying back East tomorrow, so I should be picking up my print from the [June 1st shoot](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/cat_spencer_tunick.html#000040) in New York. Hopefully I’ll get a suitably low res version scanned and uploaded shortly thereafter.
