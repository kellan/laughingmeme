As I mentioned earlier the [Frouds](http://www.worldoffroud.com) and [Gaiman](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp) are collaborating on a [feature length animated version of Tam Lin](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030509/laf031_1.html) for a new animation studio. I’m very excited by this. I can’t think of a better team to handle this classic ballad that deals with Fairie in all its unhuman, dark glory. And there in lies my question.

I think it first came up as we were leaving <cite>Finding Nemo</cite>, and discussing how Disney has started to represent non-traditional families (think Lilo and Stitch) though not divorce, and how <cite>Finding Nemo</cite> does a decent (if not great) job of broaching the subject of mental illness. I think it was [Aidan](http://sedesdraconis.com) who first asked, “How are they doing to adapt Tam Lim to be a kids movie?”

Listening to [Tempest’s](http://www.tempestmusic.com/) [Tam Lin](http://www.tempestmusic.com/multimedia/tamlin.mp3) tonight, I have to ask how do turn lines like “none go there, but leave him a pledge, either their mantles green, or else their maiden head” into kiddy fare? Or a plot like “rebellious girl gets mixed up with elf from wrong side of tracks, gets pregnant”. Admittedly it has a happy ending, but sex and horror are the key elements.

Also found out there is an entire site [devoted to Tam Lin](http://www.tam-lin.org/) in its various glory.
