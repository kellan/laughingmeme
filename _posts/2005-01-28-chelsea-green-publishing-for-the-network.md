[Chelsea Green](http://chelseagreen.com/) is a little press that is going to the network (both social and tcp/ip based) to push an agenda of getting timely important information out to the world. They’ve been definitely running a higher profile since publishing Lakoff’s new pamphlet, so it is great to see them still experimenting.

Their most recent book, [Guantanamo: What the World Should Know](http://www.chelseagreen.com/2004/items/guantanamo) has Ellen Ray interviewing the excellent [Michael Ratner](http://www.humanrightsnow.org/) (long time council for [Center for Constitutional Rights](http://www.ccr-ny.org/)). They’ve been [giving copies away](http://chelseagreen.com/2005/news/january27) to bloggers who signed a statement opposing a pro-torture Attorney General, and are now allowing [NarcoNews](http://narconews.com/) to [serialize it online](http://narconews.com/Issue35/article1160.html). I wonder if an [open book data exchange](http://pissedkid.com/archives/000744.php) might be next?
