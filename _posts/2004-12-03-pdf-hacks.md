Spent a while flipping through [PDF Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pdfhks/) in the bookstore last night (procrastinating on packing), and it looked solid. If I was going to be hacking on PDFs and ebooks, Iâ€™d pick it up, even if some of the hacks felt a bit, um, hackish, and showed a Windows bent.

Still to save you time, I can boil down well over the half the book into 2 words: [use pdftk](http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/).
