A few days of reading my [scraped CPAN RSS feed](http://dev.protest.net/~kellan/CPAN_recent.rdf), made me realize what an integral part of CPAN the PAUSE ids are. With so many…questionable…modules being uploaded it really helps to know who is what. I think this is one of the (many) examples where the CPAN clones fail to learn from CPAN’s success. So yeah, added the PAUSE ID to the feed.

**update:** I’ve moved the RSS feed (for the last time for foreseeable future) to [CPAN recent module releases](http://laughingmeme.org/feed/cpan_recent.rdf).
