Survived another year more or less intact. Only 85 more to go.

### update

 (18hrs later): early this morning (late last night) when I typed the above message, I wasn’t sure the significance of 85 years, it was on my mind, but why? I decided that I must be comptemplating my 111th birthday, as we had just re-watched <acronym title="Fellowship of the Ring">FotR</acronym>. However I’ve gradually become aware that today is not just another Armistice Day, but the 85th Armistice Day. Odd how the mind plays tricks on you like that. - [Wikipedia – Armistice/Remembrance Day](http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day)
