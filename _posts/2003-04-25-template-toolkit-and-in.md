Andy is adding [an IN operator](http://www.template-toolkit.org/pipermail/templates/2003-April/004519.html) to [Template Toolkit](http://www.tt2.org). This is nice, the order of terms in TT2’s FOREACH operator has always been a little confusing. As I’ve noted Python’s IN operator is one of my [favorite pieces of syntatic sugar](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000008.html#000008).

It was quickly pointed that TT2 [“more and more like Python”](http://www.template-toolkit.org/pipermail/templates/2003-April/004524.html). Andy returned fire by pointing out that, no, [its was becoming more like Ruby](http://www.template-toolkit.org/pipermail/templates/2003-April/004525.html). TT2, ultimate template engine, and polyglot.
