Current plans are to head down to NYC this weekend.

I’ll be hanging in Queens with friends, maybe we’ll celebrate [Stephan](http://www.livejournal.com/users/stephantravels/) finishing his thesis *Unions in a ‘Globalized’ world: has globalization undermined the efectiveness of unions, and what strategies might be effective in responding?* (or maybe I’ll just sit there with a copy and a dictionary)

Hopefully we’ll get together a [Serenity](http://serenitymovie.com/nonflash\_site/) viewing party (rumor has it that [Mr. Social Design Notes](http://www.backspace.com/notes/) himself, might also be a fan),

Definitely I’ll be at [House 2.0](http://www.amitgupta.com/house2.0/) Saturday, with [Amit](http://www.amitgupta.com), whose book [just sold out its first two print runs](http://amitgupta.com/blog/shoebox/2005/09/22/the-big-moo-were-sold-out/).

And if there is any time left after all that, maybe a little a neighborhood scouting.
