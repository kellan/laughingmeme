Starting [May 22nd](http://flickr.com/photos/straup/138407598/).

**update [2006/5/23]:** It was pointed out to me today that I was a bit opaque with this announcement. As of yesterday I’m working at [Flickr](http://flickr.com) out of the Santa Clara office, and living in San Francisco.

Btw you know you’ve arrived at a [large company](http://yahoo.com) when a hundred people turn up for the weekly new hire orientation.
