Sweet! Another item off the todo list I don’t have to do. And Scott has written an article about [how to use it as a replacement](http://lunchroom.lunchboxsoftware.com/pages/tzinfo\_rails) for Rail’s **“so-broken-its-negligent”** [TimeZone](http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/TimeZone.html) implementation.

As a hacker (is it a universal feeling?) its always an ambiguous feeling to see someone else cross an item off your todo list, a little sense of a loss (I was looking forward to solving that problem) with a bit of glee (Now I get to solve more interesting problems!)
