[Crooked Timber](http://www.crookedtimber.org) is really my favorite group blog of late, occupying largely the same spot [randomWalks](http://www.randomwalks.com/) did when I was first getting into blogs.(ah, that distant past) It’s intelligent, and insightful, and funny (I’m constantly wanting to quote bits), and the range!

Case in point, I just found a lovely thread on China Mieville, starting with CT’s post, [Speculative Economics](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002196.html): if the scifi/fantasy you’re reading isn’t dealing with economics, then you aren’t reading the right books.

Which links to an earlier piece by Henry, [Goblin Markets](http://www.henryfarrell.net/movabletype/archives/000149.html), reiterating that Meiville is a frickin world building genius.

From there the thread is picked up by John Holbo (another CT contributor), [acknowledges China’s world building](http://homepage.mac.com/jholbo/homepage/pages/blog/blog19.html#21), but questions how subversive his story telling is, but I just have to call out this bit, but it’s so perfect

> Even while I was reading, I remember having a distinct ‘can we just slow down this exciting chase scene so I can take in the scenery?’ reaction. Meiville should seriously consider writing a thumping great historical political economy of his world â€“ Marx’s <cite>Das Silmaril</cite>

Where do I sign up, I’d pre-order right now!
