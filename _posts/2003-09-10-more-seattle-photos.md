I have three galleries of new photos up from last weeks vacation. Two of them feel to me to capture the same mood. The photos of [paddling around Union Bay, Lake Washington](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/seattle_canoe), under and among the freeway bridges conjures for me the idea of perhaps a sunken city, lost to the encroaching waters of the melting ice caps, and yet who wouldn’t sacrifice a city for this attractive, glistening, mysterious landscape. The second is of [Seattle’s famous Gasworks Park](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/seattle_gasworks), which called out to me, and my love of old machinery and rust (tangible representations of the daily metaphors I juggle as a programmer), and its ironic million bucks view of the Seattle skyline. A post-apocalyptic landscape, but a droll, and intriguing one.

Also there is the photos of [Ballard Locks](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/ballard_locks), which might be of interest if you have only an academic awareness of locks, I recommend viewing the gallery as a slideshow.

And last, I re-organized the photos I had already uploaded, because I’ve found there to be entirely too many hours in the day, and too few projects to keep me busy, into [Seattle gallery](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/seattle) for ongoing shots of the city, and a [Olympic Peninsula Trip](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/olympic_trip) gallery.

Also this made possible through the magic of [iPhotoToGallery](http://zwily.com/iphoto/) (via [boris](http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/132)), which is a very nice alternative to the Gallery Remote I had been using, though it doesn’t encourage me to caption my photos the same way remote does.
