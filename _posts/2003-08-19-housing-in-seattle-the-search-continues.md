Between the pet friendly and the herb friendly listings on Craigslist, I’m having trouble finding the places I would actually want to live.

Anyone know of a cool shared living situation opening up anytime from now until mid-September in Seattle?

Looking for a friendly person/people, with a political bent to share a mellow, clean(ish), smoke and pet free house (allergies, you know), within bus/biking distance of [work](http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?ed=HfKGyep_0TroXf00oyFW9ZPBhXMluZo7&csz=Seattle+WA&country=us). (though we’ll probably be moving closer to Fremont) Communalness negoitable.

Thanks.
