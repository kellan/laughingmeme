I’ve had this silly little chorus, twiddling around my head this morning, a catch, surfy little number from the 60s, and while I can’t verify its veracity, it certainly seems to be a popular piece of this season’s mythology. (**update** see \[joshp\](http://joshp.typepad.com/15/2005/03/sure*signs*of*a.html), and \[jasonf\](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/2005/03/yahoo*never\_los.php).)
