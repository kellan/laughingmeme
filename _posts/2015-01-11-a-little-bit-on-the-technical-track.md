I’ve got a post I want to write in response to [Dan’s post on the technical track](http://mcfunley.com/thoughts-on-the-technical-track) which I think does a decent job of laying out the issues, but doesn’t cover all the challenges and I think is poor on the solutions. Barring significantly more focus and free time dropping from the sky, this clip from a recent fireside chat I did has my recent, if somewhat opaque, thinking on the topic and is the closest I’m going to get to a blog post. 2 minutes and 25 seconds.
