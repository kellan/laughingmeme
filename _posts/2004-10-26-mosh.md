Not an Eminem fan, but as M says [“when his new song is set to a video encouraging people to don black hoodies and march in the streets…”](http://red-cedar.ca/index.php?p=146) (not to mention seizing the means of communication), or as Tom puts it, [“It is moving in a very Lord of the Rings, ‘Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn look to the East”‘](http://tuttlesvc.teacherhosting.com/blog/blosxom.cgi/personal/politik/273.html).

And the video is very nice, not consistently, but there is a really gorgeous montage of animation and college used at times that I’d like to see a whole lot more of. As agitprop I wouldn’t mind a slightly more complex message, as an animation short could use a better sound track. Still nice work, and nice to see it in heavy rotation.
