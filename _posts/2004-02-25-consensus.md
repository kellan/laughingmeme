    - 'I just wanted to say how cool my family is.  3 generations and 7 distinct (and geographically dispersed) groups collaborating on selling two pieces of land owned by the family, and buying a third parcel have managed to find a natural, and easy style of doing consensus descision making, largely over email.  And it seems to be working.  I feel like I should go back and take notes.'
