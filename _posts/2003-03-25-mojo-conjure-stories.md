Was reading [Gaiman’s journal](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp "sorry, no permalinks") and he mentioned he had a story in a recently released anthology, [<cite>Mojo: Conjure Stories</cite>](http://www.twbookmark.com/books/20/0446679291/). Conjure stories are a problematic sub-genre of local color fiction. One I happen to be impressed by. And I think Gaiman is amazing. But he is also as white (if not as pure) as driven snow. I don’t know. I’m skeptical but intrigued.
