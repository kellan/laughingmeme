I was flipping through the Decemeber Wired magazine while waiting for my flight, contemplating its long sad decline, when I saw an obituary for <a hre="http://www.transmetropolitan.com/">Transmetropolitan</a>, penned by Cory Doctrow.

I haven’t thought about Transmetropolitan in a very long time, since before I was doing media activism. On reflection, Spider Jerusalem is IMC wish fulfillment — channeling cyberpunk and Hunter S. Thompson, but still wish fulfillment.

I think I might have to go back and the get the graphic novels from my new perspective. I think [Back on the Street](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1563894459/qid=/sr=/ref=cm_lm_asin/104-1511190-6720706?v=glance) was the first one.
