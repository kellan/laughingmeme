### or Why Is Pine Search So Slow?

[grepmail](http://grepmail.sourceforge.net/) searches for email in a normal or compressed mailbox using a regular expression or date constraint. I’m wondering if there is something I can do with this to improve the search speeds in Pine which have gotten dog slow since switching to a Cyrus IMAP backend. I find coping with email in the modern world impossible without Pine’s message selection features. Any one have a suggestion for speeding up search and indexing?
