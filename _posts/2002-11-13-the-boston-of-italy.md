Chatting with an elderly gentlman in a suit who is selling me $4.68 in dry socks, he asks, in a restrained diction,

*“So….where are you from?”*.  
I answer, *“San Francisco.”*; as I usually do when it is simply too much to go into the complicated, multi-coast (multi-continent) story that is the last decade of my life.  
  
*“Ahhhh”*, he says, drawing it out, as if I’ve confirmed his suspicions. *“You don’t, as they say, have the Boston accent.”*   
 I nod, and smile, unclear how to express my deep relief at this relevation to a man who in all likelihood grew up in the surrounding towns.

*“And you?”*, I ask, *“Are you from Boston?”*.  
  
*“Five generation, but I had the luck to spend much of my youth in Italy.”*  
  
*“Where abouts?”*, I ask.  
  
*“Just outside of Florence. Do you know Italy?”*   
 *“I spent a little time there 2 summers ago.”*  
*“And did you like it? How could anyone not like Italy?”* he says.   
*“Well”*, I say, feeling like I’m not quite tracking this conversation, unnaturally focused on my desire for dry socks. *“I found Florence less welcoming then other parts of Italy.”*

*“Ahhhh.”*, and this time it really hangs there in the air, the “Ahhh” pratically a third entity in the room with us. *“Florentines do tend to be more reserved. After all, they are inudated with tourists all year long,”* (I nod sympathetically), *“and, because of their superior education, family, and breeding, they tend to be less outgoing. In a way, they are the Boston of Italy.”*

At which point, we are joined by another man asking about umbrellas, and I venture back out into the rains with a new perspective on Florence.

(hmmm….I’m not sure how to format dialogue on the web, perhaps I should ask [biella](http://www.healthhacker.com/satoroams/) to keep an eye out for an elusive “Manual of Style”, I hear that they are so plentiful in Chicago, they have been declared a pest like New York’s pigeons, and visitors to the city have been asked not to feed them)
