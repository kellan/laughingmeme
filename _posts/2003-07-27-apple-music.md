Saw a billboard for [AppleMusic.com](http://applemusic.com) yesterday. That was the first time it struck me.

### Received Wisdom Needs an Upgrade?

As a long time Mac user (recently returned to the fold) with an interest in intellectual property (“all property is theft”) my received wisdom speaks of scrappy little [Apple Computers](http://www.apple.com) battling off a suit from Apple Corp, Ltd. (who seems to lack a website), by arguing that they were in the computer business and in no way diluted the trademark a certain Liverpudlian rock quartet. Apple got in trouble again when they started playing with sounds (including the infamous Sosumi beep). At the time that seemed pretty borderline, I mean, come on, how is add system beeps, and a little mic going into the music business? Applemusic.com on the other hand leaves is a little less ambiguous. So what is the story here?
