Something about [Zeroconf](http://www.zeroconf.org) seems to tap into a poetic vein. For me Rendezvous is a name to conjure [Alan Seeger](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000661.html) by, but the angelheaded hipsters at [Swampwolf](http://www.swampwolf.com) seem to have more modern influneces for their “cross-platform implementation of the Zeroconf networking standard”, [Howl](http://www.swampwolf.com/products).

Everybody is linking to it, has anyone used it?
