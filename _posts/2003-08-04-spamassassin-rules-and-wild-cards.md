For example I want to set all of the HTML_* rules to 3.0, and all of the HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_* rules to 5.0?  The amount of email that I get that contains HTML that I want to read is vanishingly small.

Just a thought, does anyone know if there is a way in [SpamAssassin](http://www.spamassassin.org) to raise the score of a whole class of rules? For example I want to set all of the HTML\_\* rules to 3.0, and all of the HTML\_IMAGE\_ONLY\_\* rules to 5.0? The amount of email that I get that contains HTML that I want to read is vanishingly small. (note, not all of it falls under the normal definition of spam)

Also it would be nice if SAâ€™s learning applied not only on tokens, but to rules as well.
