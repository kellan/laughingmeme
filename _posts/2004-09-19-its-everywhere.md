I’ve been finding lately I need a firebreak, some real physical separation from the network in order to focus. This is surprisingly hard to find. I headed out this morning with that explicit intention to Fast Eddie’s in Ballard, as a known non purveyor of wireless. And yet, what is this? An open network, SSID ‘ratfink’ in keeping with Fast Eddie’s rat pack style? Is there anywhere in this city without wireless? I might have to move back to Boston just to get any work done.
