Rabble: [Indymedia’s future, between the elite core and the global decentralized consensus process](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000038.html#000038).

About the failure (and surprising success) of IMC’s attempts to build a global process, trust based organizing in a loose network, and IMC’s disfunction when the trust is lacking. You can feel the frustration underneath the words, but it is also uplifiting.
