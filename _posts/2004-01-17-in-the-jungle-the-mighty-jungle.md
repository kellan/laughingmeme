I finally made the switch to Panther (OS X 10.3), which has been sitting on my shelf for a month, waiting for a fee moment. So far it is treating me well, with a few quirks.

It seems zippier (and I haven’t add the new 512M of RAM which finally arrived from Crucial), but then I haven’t been pushing it yet. (when I start running Eclipse I’ll get back to you)

With the exception of the new icon hilighting, I hate the new Finder. Tog addresses this, [“Microsoft also has huge, wasteful, low-density windows. They are also horrible, and Apple need not emulate them.”](http://www.asktog.com/columns/061PantherReview.html)

Expose has not yet entered my work flow, but it seems cool. I also get the feeling that as I become more attached to it, I’ll start using tabs less and less, as tabbed windows are much harder to scan for in Expose. I backed up my media to CDs, checked my docs, and projs folders into CVS, and did an ‘Archive and Install’.

[LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/) has entered my flow, and is critical. Computers aren’t worth using without it, the new 3.3beta3 adds “improved Panther compatibility”, so I installed it.

[XChat-Aqua](http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/) has a hiccup where the private message alert icon isn’t going away. (ooh, there is a new version \[0.12.0\] I should download)

The Cmd-Tab is functional, fast, and beautiful. The crisp, large icons (I’m only running a handful of apps) are very pleasing.

I’m having to re-install all my Perl modules (probably because of the ‘Archive and Install’, but they are installing relatively smoothly.

I also had to do a [fink upgrade](http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/10.3-upgrade.php
). Fink didn’t want to upgrade because the latest packaged version of [jed](http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/) requires x11. I could have installed jed-nox, but I took this opportunity to [ get Apple’s X11 working.](<http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-packages.php#apple-x11-no-windowbar >) Then I installed jed-nox, because its better ![:)](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

PEAR is broken in Apple’s default PHP (they failed to include System.php). `curl http://go-pear.org/ | sudo php` fixed that. However PHP was segfaulting for reasons unknown, so I switched back to Marc Liyanage’s [PHP for OSX](http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/).

BBedit’s “Go” command when from the “File Open” dialog went away, and I can’t get it back. It never worked great, but it worked. I’m becoming less and less enchanted with BBedit. I should really take another stab at getting [Nedit](http://nedit.org/) working.

Had to re-setup my stunnels. I use [SSLEnabler](http://homepage.mac.com/iclements/SSLEnabler.html).
