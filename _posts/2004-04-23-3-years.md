Contrary to reports I’ve seem (maybe they’ve changed it) you **can** delete emails from [Gmail](http://gmail.com). They just discourage it. Stacy did some [quick figuring](http://contraversion.com/index.php?p=blogarchive/2004_04_01_archive.php#108275942439982484) and judged at her current rate of email, she won’t have to delete a message until 2050 or so. According to procmail, I get about 7M of mail a week, so if I were to switch over to Gmail as my primary address I’m looking at sometime in 2007. In other news 1 gigabytes is a lot of text!
