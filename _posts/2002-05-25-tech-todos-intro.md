Entering my second week in Seattle, its been great, but spending all this time talking to people about Indymedia, has made my todo list, grow longer, and longer. So here are 4 projects I’m working on right now, or am thinking about building (and wishing I could find existing code that did it)

And this doesn’t even include the long list of projects that got generated last night at a [Red Cusor Collective](http://home.riseup.net/about-riseup/about-us.html) meeting about grant writing.

Definitely one of those, “I’m so far behind on the todo list, I’ll never die” moments. Now if only I could get paid for a few projects, life would be good.
