Thank you to all 12 people who downloaded my little [object oriented hack of MT::Comments](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001283.html) to add blacklists a week ago Sunday. [Jay’s version is out now](http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2003/10/mtblacklist_monday_hell_or_high_water), almost certainly more elegantly done, and generating inifinitely more excitement. I think maybe I should give up, and go back to being a poet (or, as I never was a poet, at least writing about Bakhtin’s Poetics).

Of course stopping coding assumes it an act of volition, instead of something I do half conciously, when I’m too tired or burnt to think about anything else, a refuge of cause and effect and function from a fragmented, plural, and confusing world.
