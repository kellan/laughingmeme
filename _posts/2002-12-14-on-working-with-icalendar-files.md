Apple has posted a great document discussing [iCalendar files](http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/icalendarfiles.html). Entitled “iCalendar Files on Mac OS X”, it goes **way** beyond that by talking openly about the iCalendar format, the role of .Mac, and third-party services (like [iCal Exchange](http://www.icalx.com)), and giving examples of how to parse iCalendar files with [Perl’s Reefknot](http://reefknot.sf.net), or [PHP iCalendar](http://phpicalendar.sf.net). Classy. And much more accessible then anything the CALSCH working group has ever put out.
