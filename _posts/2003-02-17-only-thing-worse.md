    - 'The only thing worse then arguing politics, is argueing them online.  I hate it.  It exhausts me, and depress me.  Its so futile, even when I try really really hard to stick to just a few small facts.  I need to stop doing it.  I\''m going to go stare at the blizzard now, and figure out if I think I would survive trying to walk to the movie theater from here.'

The only thing worse then arguing politics, is argueing them online. I hate it. It exhausts me, and depress me. Its so futile, even when I try really really hard to stick to just a few small facts. I need to stop doing it. Iâ€™m going to go stare at the blizzard now, and figure out if I think I would survive trying to walk to the movie theater from here.
