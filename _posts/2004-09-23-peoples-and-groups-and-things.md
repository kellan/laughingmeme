So odd to realize that quite by accident, one day, when you weren’t looking, you woke up and realized you were “in a space”. Or maybe just a consensus reality. A space where [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) and [Ridiculously Easy Group Forming](http://www.myelin.co.nz/wcswiki/w/RidiculouslyEasyGroupForming), and “social software” are all obviously connected, and have a great deal to say about the future of communication, organizing, and network intelligence.

Which is all by way of saying, I had a very interesting chat with the [The Robot Co-op](http://robotcoop.com) guys.
