Gmail’s new web clipping feature is nice. Decent if sparse selection of feeds (doesn’t feel like a straight pay for placement deal), good interface for adding, selecting.

Minor detail: adding new feeds to the system seems to be broken. (Google is really cutting themselves slack these days about rolling out half finished features aren’t they?)

Best possible feature? No text to unbold! My days are already spent unbolding text, or feeling guilty about the ridiculously large bold (now turning red, now blinking) number which signifies my news folders’ backlog.

Much nicer. Obviously not a replacement, but as an addition to my existing aggregator, its great.

On a related note, what are people subscribed to for their news these days?

**update**: Well that was short lived. Should have seen it coming, but would it be too much to ad just one feature not targetted to selling more ads? I’m pretty sure “Catch More Bass”, wasn’t listed in any of my feeds. Siiiigh.
