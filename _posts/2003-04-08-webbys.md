Well the [2003 Webby nominees](http://www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/nominees.html) have been anounced and the [activism](http://www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/nominees.html#activism) category has finally gone as bland and corporate as they’ve always wanted it to be. Maybe we didn’t get invited because Rabble [stole the award](http://www.protest.net/view.cgi?view=2199) last year?

**double take:** wow. that was 2 years ago? time is moving so fast these days I’m getting dizzy

**update:** [Webbys go “virtual”](http://news.com.com/2100-1025-998465.html?tag=lh). My, my, how far we’ve come.
