I saw this eye catching poster in a small burrito shop in Eureka, on our way to Arcata for the Protest.net retreat. Suddenly I longed to be back in the Bay Area, perhaps back to 1997 when I first lived in SF, and Critical Mass was just that, a mass movement, political, social, spiritual, sweeping the streets of San Francisco. Some of the headiness of those rides is gone, but Iâ€™ve found that fun, and community of them is still there, and has transfered itself all over the world. So come out and ride next Friday, and join in. See more by the artist, [Mona Caron](http://www.monacaron.com/~mona/images/html/cmp_poster.html) |
