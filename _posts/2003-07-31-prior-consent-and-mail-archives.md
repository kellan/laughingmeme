Trust the W3C to get it right. (except for that whole XML Schema thing) I sent a quick note to a W3C mailinglist today, and I got an automated notice back asking for my permission to include the message in their web archives. I was given the option of “Yes, include this message in the archive”, “Include all my messages in the archives”, “Don’t include this message in the archive”.

Brilliant I tell you! If we had that for the [IMC mailing lists](http://lists.indymedia.org) that would probably cut down on 30-40 irate support requests a month.

Anyone know what software they are using to do this?
