I’d submit that the $1,200 \[Esther Dyson shindig at Stanford today\](http://www.release1-0.com/events/When2index.php) was actually When 2.2, having coined the term to describe the Saturday morning calendar track at Foocamp.

The big news is the \[Google Calendar no-show\](http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/12/06/google\_calendarnot.html). Also on people’s minds \[where is Chandler?\](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2238)

Perhaps the most striking feature of When 2.0 at Foocamp was how different the understanding of events each person brought to the table. Some people where talking events as social objects, others time management, perhaps as part of data management sync problem, and Esther was excited about time aspect of search. There was much talking past each other.
