> “This, is what geotagging photos is all about, it’s about having enough of them, millions and millions, so that they can be thrown through complex analysis, allowing them to be matched up, combined, calculated and computed into a geo-spatal context. It’s also about people sharing the world about them. Start of mini rant: You’ll see that all these advances are made by Google and Microsoft …” – \[Rev. Dan Catt\](http://geobloggers.com/2010/02/12/flickr-photos-now-in-bing-maps/).
