> Historically there were a few days between the end of one year, and the beginning of the next that people took to be days out of the normal flow, a chance to do the things you didnâ€™t have time to do, or werenâ€™t allowed to do the rest of the year. This is the origin of Carnival, and Mardi Gras and related ceremonies. (this is according to Bakhtin, Iâ€™m not wearing my calendar geek hat when I say this, so be warned)

> We no longer have the wonderful concept of a few days each year out of time, but once, every four years we do get a leap day. Donâ€™t waste it. – [Happy Leap Day – 2004/02/29](http://laughingmeme.org/2004/02/29/happy-leap-day/)
