Had a very nice weekend driving and hiking around Vermont and New Hampshire. Even stopped off in Brattleboro to meet up with Josh (aka protest.net’s talented sysadmin) on Sunday and we spent the day hiking around Temple Mt. That would be the same day Yada (the protest.net server which also hosts LM) decided to have serious hardware failure.

We’re back up for now. There is some concern that the we’ve got a problem which is being heat triggered which we haven’t fixed yet. So when I wrote, “I expect you all to have fixed the world by the time I get back”, this isn’t quite what I had in mind.

When it looks like we’re going to be stable, I’ll upload the pictures from this weekend, in the mean time, [a small sample](http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035734193@N01/sets/21396/) is up on flickr.
