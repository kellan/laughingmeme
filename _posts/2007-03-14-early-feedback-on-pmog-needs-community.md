Okay [PMOG](http://bud.com/) is **super** early in its life, but it intrigues me on a couple of levels (not the least of which is the [engaging archetype art](http://bud.com/images/promo/poster-lg.jpg)).

However there are some things about it which are broken. Not surprising in and of itself, but in the process of trying to report said broken-ness I ran into a larger problem.

No community space.

There is a Google Group but it’s a moderated announce only kind of thing (HINT: thats what you’re blog is for!) not a public discussion space. No message boards, no wiki (though presumably we could start one, [Twitter Fan](http://twitter.pbwiki.com/) style), no groups.

Someone needs to see [Andy’s](http://waxy.org) talk about group forming, social software, and out of band spaces.

Especially for a game, a social game, an experimental game.

**Uninstalled for now**, in an attempt to reduce unexplainable spinnies.
