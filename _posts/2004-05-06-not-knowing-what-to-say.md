    - "There have been a dozen entries about the current state of Iraq which has appeared, and then disappeared from this blog as I struggle to find proper voice to my feelings.  They were catalogs of abuse, badly reasoned historical analogies, sardonic suggestions for paying off our mounting debt by taxing the public supporters of this war, speculations of war crimes tribunals.  None of them really adding to the conversation.\n\nReally its a roiling mess of emotion of which anger is the most prominent.  Angry that these sort of abuses are going on in my name, and then furious to think that everything I did (many many people did more) to prevent this utterly horrific debacle from coming to pass were ineffective.  I think that is at the deep, dark core of emotion that makes me feel unbalanced, makes me want to lash out and hurt the people who have done this, that 18 months ago it seemed so clear and easy to avoid this, but now we\\'ve 10,000+ lives, $100+ billion dollars to reach this desperately broken state of affairs."
