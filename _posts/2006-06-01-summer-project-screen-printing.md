I’ve been meaning to take up screen printing for a while, the natural zenith (nadir?) of living the “tshirt couture” style. Recently this plan has come to something of a head faced with the crisis which is being in Silicon Valley.

Case in point: on an evening last week I counted 9 Threadless shirts on the shuttle from work. (not to mention 7 Timbuk2 bags, and 4 Chromes), a number rounded out to an even baker’s dozen on the 3 block walk home. To say nothing of phenomena known as \[Cal’s shirts\](http://www.flickr.com/groups/42314711@N00/).

Found a \[group in Oakland\](http://www.rpscollective.com/) teaching classes, and \[Astro Press\](http://www.astropress.net/) looks **very** promising for printing up small runs.

Any other resources folks got?
