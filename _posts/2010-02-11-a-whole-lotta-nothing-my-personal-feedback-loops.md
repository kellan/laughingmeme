> “**Flickr** offers the wonderful [Recent Activity page](http://www.flickr.com/activity/) that I loved so much I copied it for MetaFilter. It's pretty much the ultimate tool for finding what has happened with your content on the network and I hope other services are watching and following suit. I would love to see an internet-wide tool that worked like this to track stuff people have said about my writing/photos as well as any followups on comments I left on any other blog. Many companies have tried, no one has succeeded yet.” – [Matt Haughey](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2010/02/my-personal-feedback-loops.html)

Yay! That almost makes it worth how much pain it was to build that page. The [whole post](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2010/02/my-personal-feedback-loops.html) is good, a couple of neat tricks I’d missed for tracking the conversations.
