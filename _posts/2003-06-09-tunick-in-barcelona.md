Spencer Tunick beat his own Melbourne record of 4,500 people posing, with [7000 people laid out on Maria Cristina Ave., Barcelona](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/08/1055010879305.html). (And [a different pose](http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_788704.html).)

During our travels around the Mediterranean two summers ago, Jasmine and I found Barcelona to be a city of amazingly vibrant street life and beautiful people. We almost didnâ€™t leave. A fitting place for a Spencer Tunick shot.
