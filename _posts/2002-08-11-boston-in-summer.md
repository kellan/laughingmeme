Why is it that everyone can’t just move to Santa Cruz, or somewhere equally pleasant? I’m in Boston for the month, and I’m sticking to things. The heat, and humidity is sapping what little wit I usually bring to bear upon this spot.

However, the world refuses to migrate to me, alas.

And to anyone who has been riding the New Yok 7 line, I met the guy responsible for those Lava Life ads last night. He was exactly as you imagine him, buffed, clean, smooth, and friendly to all. Utterly unlikeable. And Canadian. He said the response to the ads have been great, and they’ll be rolling it out to all the major metropolises this Fall. You had to call didn’t you? Thanks NYC.
