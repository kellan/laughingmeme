[![First Cup March 27, 2008](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2019/2367538027_f4850110d3.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogmilque/2367538027/ "First Cup March 27, 2008 by dogmilque, on Flickr")

Steve Ford’s \[first cups\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogmilque/2367538027/) is probably my favorite photo project on Flickr. I’ve been watching for photos of his first cup of coffee each morning for nearly 3 years now (Oct 18th, 2005, when I saw and faved \[this photo from Ritual\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogmilque/24342722/in/set-532968/)). And today he uploaded number \[1,000\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogmilque/2367538027/).

And I remember the first drink Steve ever poured for me, at the Linden alley location, in late March 2005, when I was living in Boston, and flying out to consult for \[Odeo\](http://odeo.com). After that I started flying the 3,000 miles for the coffee, and doing the Odeo consulting on the side.

Flickr trivia: \[First Cup\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogmilque/sets/532968/) was the first set on Flickr to get a feed (an official one at least).

Congrats Steve.
