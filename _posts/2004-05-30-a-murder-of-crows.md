I am having a seriously <cite>Dark is Rising</cite> weekend.

Yesterday I had 3 crows follow me 5 blocks, 2 behind, 1 ahead, as if bracketing me, cawing constantly. This morning I woke up to a hideously loud cawing, only to look out my window directly into the eye of a crow not 12 inches away. (I admit I yelped) And this evening I just got back to find 12 crows sitting on my porch.

Iâ€™m looking forward to getting out of town for a couple of days.
