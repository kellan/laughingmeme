I’ve moved so many times you think there would be no new ideas left to think regarding packing.

2. Turns out that there is a significant difference in packing up and moving someone’s house then in striking the latest room where I’ve been camping out and keeping my books out of the rain, even a minimalist like Jasmine.
3. If you’re moving in Boston, I’d recommend the [Gentle Giant movers](http://www.gentlegiant.com/), it added up fairly fast, but they made amazingly short work of moving the house down 2 flights of narrow steps at one end, and up the 3 flights of even narrower steps at the other end. (and I l ike the giant purple trucks)
4. I wonder if Ikea intentionally designs its furniture to disintegrate when you attempt to disassemble it — easy to put together, impossible to pack and move — and thereby ensuring a steady stream of replacement buys.
5. Your local alt. weekly can make a great supply of emergency late night packing material, try to pick the one with the large corporate owners. In fact the near endless supply of newspaper was so useful I wonder if the alt. weeklies plan for this in their end of month print runs.
