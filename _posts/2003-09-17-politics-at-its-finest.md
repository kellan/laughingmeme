We seem to be [stepping up our rhetoric against Syria](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3115094.stm), those human rights abusing, terrorist harboring, WMD holding evil-doers. In facts Rumsfeld claims to know [where the MiGs are buried .](http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20030917-083114-4872r.htm)

Like we knew where the nukes were buried?

In other knews, Syria, the only Arab nation on the UN Security Council, [strongly condemmed the U.S. veto](http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-3159286,00.html) of a resolution calling for Israel to cease threatneing Arafat. Some see the U.S. veto as green lighting an assassination attempt.
