Billed as a “crass attempt to steal from Harpers”, [Kendall’s Weekly Review](http://www.monkeyfist.com/articles/820) inescapably puts me in mind of the Kafka quote, “There is hope, but not for us.”

> [regime change… there is no capitalism without conscience… Bush was “initially uncooperative” … lawsuit was filed against VP Dick Cheney … $58 billion to store up to 70,000 tons of nuclear waste at the Yucca Mountain… synthesized functional polio… UK reclassified marijuana as a Class C drug… UWC has first African supercomputer in to be used solely for research, including AIDS research](http://www.monkeyfist.com/articles/820)
