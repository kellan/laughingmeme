Recently started using [Simple Test](http://www.lastcraft.com/simple\_test.php) for a couple of projects (even slipped it in at work, but sssh! don’t tell them!). So far I’m very happy with it. Using [PHPUnit](http://www.google.com/search?q=PHPUnit) was always a bit of a non-starter, it felt heavy, and even which version (fork?) to use was ambiguous.

Simple Test’s documentation beyond the basics start to trail off, but the code is eminently readable (better then docs any day!), and I found writing a harness to work with the [feedparser tests](http://feedparser.org/tests/) pleasantly straightforward.

Recommended.
