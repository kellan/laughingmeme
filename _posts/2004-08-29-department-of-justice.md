Justice Department [censors the Supreme Court](http://www.thememoryhole.org/feds/justice_redaction.htm), and [subpoenas IMC](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/30/politics/campaign/30delegates.html) for publicly available whois information, and the server logs we donâ€™t keep. Of course last time this happened, the FBI dropped the case just days before appearing in court in order to avoid having their case rejected with prejudice.

Just in case you were wondering what it was that the DoJ did with its $20 billion in discretionary spending.

**update:** scanned copy of the [subpeona](http://images.indymedia.org/imc/grand_jury_subpoena_20040819.pdf), I notice they got the IP address wrong, just like last time.
