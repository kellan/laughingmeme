Finally re-discovered the joys of productivity these last few days. Thursday morning I woke up realizing that I had read a lot of neat websites, posted a couple of good entries to my blogs, futz with the [TechFed wiki](http://notes.techfed.net), answers lots of IMC support emails, and chatted with lots of neat people on IRC, but I had nothing to show for the week. Nor last week neither.

But many lines of code, odds bugs, struggling with [Pair’s idiosyncrasies](http://pair.com) and long phone calls, I’ve **finally** wrapped up my paying contract. Its been dragging on for months; first they were flaky, then I was back East, then they were traveling, then I was at [Ruckus](http://ruckus.org), etc…

Some things I’m (re-)learning about myself, and self-employment are.

- I don’t work well on the road.  
    I can keep my basic communication obligations from the odd coffeeshop, borrowed net connection, and occasional Kinkos. Especially the awful boring code hat pays my few bills.
- Coding requires more caffeine.  
    A cup or two staves off the headaches, but its takes more then that to reach the anti-meditative state where I can I really crank. At Palm I never had to face up to this reality, the coffee pot was never empty, and no one said, “Wow! I’ve never see someone go through a coffee card in a single day”

But now its done. And I can get back to fun projects, and figuring out if I have time to go to Seattle and help organize for the [September NAB meeting](http://www.reclaimthemedia.org) before heading back to NYC for Jasmine’ birthday.
