I was sitting here, deeply amused and tempted, but also asking myself if I had the courage to wear a t-shirt with the words [I SHOT JR.](http://www.glarkware.com/securestore/c181845p16266280.2.html) emblazoned on a picture of Texas. After all, what if someone actually did shoot G.W. Bush Jr., would I find myself hauled in front of some Homeland Security secret tribunal merely for owning the damn thing?

Then I read the caption next to the shirt. Apparently its a reference to some TV show called “Dallas” from the 70s, and not a mock confession of murderous intent against our current, dearly beloved president. How droll. I feel much less tempted.
