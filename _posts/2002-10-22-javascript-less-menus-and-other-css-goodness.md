I’ll admit it. I’m inconsistent. I yelled at the designer on a recent project that their DHTML/Javascript/Whizbang menus didn’t work under Netscape browsers. His soluiton? Write a browser detect script (using [HTTP::BrowserDetect](http://search.cpan.org/author/LHS/HTTP-BrowserDetect-0.97/BrowserDetect.pm), like [browserhawk](http://www.cyscape.com/), but it actually works, and is a hell of a lot cheaper) and require 5.0 browsers.

But [CSS based menus](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/menus/demo.html) are different! They’re cool! They aren’t a hack! They don’t work under IE! (who still uses IE? no one I know) Alright, enough irrational exhuberance. Must get back to cleaning out the inbox.
