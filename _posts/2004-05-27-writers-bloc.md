I’ve made a handful of passing references over the years to the genre I call “New Wave Socialist Scottish Sci-Fi” of which the principle proponents are [Iain Banks](http://www.iainbanks.net/) and [Ken Macleod](http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/), but also [Charlie Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi), and (though he comes from a bit farther south) [China Meiville](http://www.panmacmillan.com/Features/China/). While there is some obvious accuracy to the moniker, I mostly used it to amuse myself, and as a way to speaking about this group of authors who are currently producing some of the most interesting, amusing, creative and yet relevant literature anywhere.

However reading [Stross’ blog](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi) this evening, I found that there is significant truth to my turn of phrase. Checkout the [Edinburgh Writers Bloc](http://www.writers-bloc.org.uk/). They’ve got a whole movement going on up there. (no word on whether they do their readings in balaclavas)
