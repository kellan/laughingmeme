People are still too stiff and rigid with their tagging technique. Loosen up. You don’t have to find the “right category” to put something into, that is part of the [tyranny and inflexibility](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002360.html#002360) of a classification scheme that we’re trying to get away from. Don’t tell me what it is, the “truth” of it as it were. Tell my why it matters.

For example I use the tag [“inspiration”](http://del.icio.us/kellan/inspiration) to keep track of ideas I want to steal, or think about more on my various projects. ([inspiration+redesign](http://del.icio.us/kellan/inspiration+redesign) are my first notes towards a [Magpie re-design](http://magpierss.sf.net))

Variations on [toread](http://del.icio.us/tag/toread), and [*toread](http://del.icio.us/tag/*toread) are in wide use as useful meta-tags, and a handful of people are using variants to track specific research projects, or tasks.

[Marnie is experimenting](http://ext337.blogspot.com/2005/01/folks-are-jumping-on-to-tagging.html) with the tag [nptech](http://del.icio.us/tag/nptech) to build a community of non-profit tech workers, we’re using a different tag for the our [anarchist tech work](http://cats.protest.net), and there are a handful of bibliographies being organized around a specific indicator tag.

And lastly don’t be afraid to build combos. One of the key ways tags work is the set logic of multiple tags. They’re your links on [redesign inspiration](http://del.icio.us/kellan/inspiration+redesign), [javascript usability](http://del.icio.us/tag/javascript+usability), [Boston bakeries](http://del.icio.us/tag/boston+bakery), or [Photoshop books](http://del.icio.us/tag/photoshop+books).
