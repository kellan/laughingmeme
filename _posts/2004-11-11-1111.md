It is Nov. 11th again, seems to [happen every year](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001406.html#001406), and every year the hopes of [Armistice Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day) and its declaration of the end of war seem farther way.

[Global Security](http://www.globalsecurity.org) has a break down on the deployment of [the nearly 400,000 uniformed soliders who are serving overseas](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/deploy.htm) maintaining U.S. global domination. (no word on the various non-uniformed military personnel who make up the 1.4+ million future veterans who make up a force larger the rest of the worlds combined military)

Itâ€™s enough to make you want to change your birthday.
