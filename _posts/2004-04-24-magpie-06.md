[MagpieRSS 0.6](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55691&package_id=50728&release_id=233643) is out. It was a rather long alpha, hopefully that means people tried it, and it worked.

Key features are

- support for [private RSS feeds](http://labs.silverorange.com/archives/2003/july/privaterss) (via SSL, and HTTP Auth Basic) is working again.
- refactored the code to support Atom’s [“content constructs”](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php#rfc.section.3.1), now supports: `atom:title, atom:tagline, atom:copyright, atom:info, atom:summary`, and `atom:content`. Thanks to [Tim Bishop](http://geodog.thebishop.net/) for feedback and encouragement.

**update:** – where “refactor” meant introduced bugs. [MagpieRSS 0.61](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55691) is now out.

### Atom

Quick [review](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001676.html)- Content is normalized. You can access core RSS elements using Atom field names and visa vera.
- `atom:content` is stored in `$item['atom<em>content']</em>` to avoid clashing with RSS modcontent.
- [content constructs](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php#rfc.section.3.1) are flattened (as if they were always `mode="escaped"`)
- Everything else is concatted into hierachical namespace.
- I’ve made no attempt to support base64 encoding

### Private RSS (and Atom)

- To access a feed via SSL use the `https://` scheme, e.g. `https://example.org/index.rdf`
- To access a feed behind basic HTTP authentication include the username and password in the URL, e.g. `http://username:password@example.org/index.rdf`
- And, no surprises here, you can combine them `https://username:password@example.org/index.rdf`

It would be useful if someone could step up and maintain a list of aggregators that support private RSS feeds, a matrix of support for SSL, HTTP Basic Auth, and HTTP Digest Auth, like [Ted](http://www.sauria.com/blog) has done for [GZIP encoding](http://www.sauria.com/blog/articles/aggregator-gzip.html). (Danny [started to put together a feature matrix](http://www.ideagraph.net/aggregators/#authentication) but it looks like that project was stillborn.)
