Learned a new word tonight from \[MattB\](http://hackdiary.com), \[SimonB\](http://hitherto.net), and \[Yoz\](http://www.yoz.com/).

> A hashbot is a robot that hangs out on an IRC channel (hence the #) and provides a conversational interface to a resource.

hashbots are the ancestors of \[Social Software for Robots\](http://laughingmeme.org/2007/05/18/slideshare-social-software-for-robots/), and the idea of Twitter/YubNub as Web CLI.
