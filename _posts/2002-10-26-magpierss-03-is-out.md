MagpieRSS is the PHP RSS parser I wrote, because I was unhappy with all the existing solutions.(which you already know if you read this space regularily) Its designed to be easy to use, and easy on the system, without giving up functionality. Hi-lights include: a super easy, one method interface to the object oriented backend, and an integrated caching system.(the origin of the name)

Version 0.3 (0.2 was an internal release) adds [conditional gets](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001132.html), as well as a major overhaul of the options system, more and better comments, and general clean up.

See the [Magpie website](http://magpierss.sf.net), for more info, or [download](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55691)and enjoy.
