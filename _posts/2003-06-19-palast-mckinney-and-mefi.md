MeFi has a [nice little thread](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/26489) going about yesterday’s Greg Palast story on [McKinney getting screwed by the media](http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=16172). Always good to see the racists out in force.(the MeFi consensus seems to be that black presidential canidates are hilarious, especially women) By the way if you read through the comments, don’t be taken in by all those “scare links”, the web’s version of scare quotes, if you actually follow any of those links you’ll see that they don’t contradict, and in fact often support, Palast’s thesis. By the way, as implied by yesterday’s MLP, Palast’s story also has a few wonderful gems hilighting why the NYTimes is still [the paper of record.](http://laughingmeme.org/mlp/archives/2003_06.html#000881)
