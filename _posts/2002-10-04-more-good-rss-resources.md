AmphetaDesk has some great documentation on [finding RSS channels](http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/finding_more.html), including a bookmarklets to do [RSS discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/31.html), and a visual guide for icons which commonly imply RSS feeds.

This dovetails in nicely with the work that Mark has done on his [ultra liberal RSS locator](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#ultraliberal_rss_locator). The idea is to apply a number of heurisitcs for trying to discover a websites RSS feed, when you only know its URL. An idea codified into python by [rssfinder.py](http://diveintomark.org/projects/misc/rssfinder.py.txt). (apparently [Straw](http://www.helsinki.fi/~pakaste/straw.html), a python RSS aggregator, uses rssfinder.py, but bad interactions between Debian’s Python2.1 packages \[required by xchat\] and my source installed 2.2 means I haven’t played with it yet)

Finally, Mnot (whose RSS parser I use for [weblog watch](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000127.html#000127)) has put together a gentle but informative [RSS tutorial](http://www.mnot.net/rss/tutorial/).
