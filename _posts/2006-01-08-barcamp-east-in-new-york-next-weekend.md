[BarCamp NYC](http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampNYC) is next weekend, and with it the East Coast gets its inaugral un-conference. ([FooCamp](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp05/index.cgi), [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampPaloAlto2005), and [MindCamp](http://seattlemind.com/) all being West Coast affairs, and [Amsterdam](http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampAmsterdam) being spiritually closer to the West Coast then anywhere on the Atlantic Seaboard I’m thinking)

Registration is open, attendance is free, accomodation is urban camping.

Also if anyone has a suggestion for a talk for me to give, I’m coming up blank, I’ve handed out a number of excellent (IMHO) suggestions to others, but not feeling the inspiration personally.
