I am now the proud owner of <cite>The West Wing, Season Two</cite> DVD set, with Chinese subtitles (optional). And I’ve now used eBay for the first time, making me a real, live Internet user. Pretty soon, I’ll ditch my AOL account, and maybe put up a personal homepage. (do people still do that?)

So far it hasn’t been as laugh out loud funny as the first season, but that could be something about my preferred viewing time of after midnight, and stressed.

Loved this exchange from last night’s episode, discussing education.

> Sam: We need a permanent revolution.  
> Toby: Where have I heard that?  
> S: Permanet revolution?  
> T: Yeah.  
> S: From a book  
> T: What book?  
> S: [pause] A little red book.  
> T: You think we should quote Mao Tse-Tung?

Makes a certain amount of sense actually, as the Maoists, and their mass culture were some of the first people to take education seriously, a point not addressed by the show. Not a model I would want to emulate however, but interesting, and why I love this show. Doubly interesting as I’m watching it on DVDs shipped from China which, while quite nice, with good picture and sound, have a definite cottage industry feel about them, if you know what I mean. Talk about your free market. But isn’t a “permanent revolution” a Trotskyist ideal?
