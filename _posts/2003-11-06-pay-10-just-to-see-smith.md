Well the reviewers all hate [*Revolutions*](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/TheMatrixRevolutions-1127201/), but the consensus at [Espresso Splendido ](http://www.geocities.com/kaze750/seattletour3.html) is it is one of the best movies ever made. A bit of probing revealed that despites its mild mannered appearance as a hole in the wall espresso bar, Espresso Splendido is actually the headquarters of the Seattle of “Hugo Weaving is the most talented actor in the last 20 years” fan club. As I’m inclined to agree that Weaving [is brilliant](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000286.html#hugoweaving), I think this might be the one possible inducement to get me to go see the *Rev*, even though I’ve successfully avoid seeing *Reloaded*.
