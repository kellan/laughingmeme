    - 'Jasmine and I drove up to Arcata to see <a href=\"http://www.anarchogeek.com\">rabble</a>, and commune with redwoods for the holidays.  Spent the day at Redwood National Park, fording washed out roads, jumping swollen streams, and picking through fallen trees.   I have some great photos on my new toy, a Canon PowerShot S230 that was my Xmas/birthday present, unfortunately I haven\''t figured out how to get it to work with Linux yet.  Tonight the 3 of us headed back to the Bay Area.  2 hours down the road, we were turned back.  Highway 101 is completely blocked by a landslide in a key spot were the only alternative routes are dirt roads, or peaks that are snowed in.  Touching stories about the time when the road was closed for 3 weeks are not raising our hopes about catching a Thursday flight back to the East coast, which apparently is having its own weather fun.'
