I **so** want \[RDF+Rails\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002974.html#002974), want it bad enough that looking at \[these code samples\](http://www.jroller.com/page/obie/20050614#more*about*ontologies) is enough to leave my flustered and distracted their so cool:

```
class Person < ActiveOntology::Base

 definition "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/index.rdf"

```
