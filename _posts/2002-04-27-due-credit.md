Its a “mindbomb” as [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com) would say. Just when you had given up hope of a reasoned response, you get [Sharon Must Go](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/sharonMustGo).

And while we’re giving Dave his due, I’m really liking [NY Times auto-blog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0102250/).  
Its the Times’ news stripped of the editorial “prioritizing”.

All of a sudden items you might have missed on page 53, really [jump out at you](http://radio.weblogs.com/0102250/2002/04/26.html#a1108), like the House Energy and Commerce Committee [votes 41 to 6 to go ahead with dumping nuclear waste](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/26/politics/26YUCC.html?ex=1020484800&en=e800d388d973b9fc&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND)

ps. my favorite Yucca site seems to have shut down, anyone know some new sites?
