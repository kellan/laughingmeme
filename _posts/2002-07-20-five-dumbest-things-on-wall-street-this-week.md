Including Fox News’ stellar coverage of WorldCom coverage. Seems Fox reported that al Qaeda was behind the WorldCom’s financial collapse, as well as that of Global Crossing, ImClone, and Xerox. The story linked to by [TheStreet](http://thestreet.com) no longer contains these brilliant insights, perhaps because they were based on information gathered from a story specifically labelled as “a flight of fancy.”
