Morbus Iff has hacked up some code to [publish an .ics file from within Moveable Type](http://www.disobey.com/dnn/2002/09/index.shtml#001373). Meaning you could now subscribe to someoneâ€™s blog from within iCal. Personally I think the other direction, iCal to MT, would be cooler, but thats probably in the pipe somewhere.
