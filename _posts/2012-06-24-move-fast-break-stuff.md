You know that argument you’ve gotten into about whether pushing out an experimental feature is a good idea that goes something like, “If we offer this we can never take it back, so let’s be careful”? It’s akin to the argument, “It needs to be perfect, because first impressions are everything.” They’re reasonable fears that often morph into stasis, because we forget that change should feel risky and scary, and if it isn’t then we’re moving to slow.

I imagine if you were going to roll out your own currency system that people exchanged real dollars for that would be an example of something you need to make sure you got right because you could never take it back.

One of the reasons Facebook is where it is is because \[they don’t subscribe to that mental trap.\](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/06/19/introducing-subscriptions-and-local-currency-pricing/) Refreshing to see.
