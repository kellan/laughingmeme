I might have already mentioned something about being semi-delirious, but catching up on the last couple of weeks of heavy heavy traffic on the [Perl datetime](http://archive.develooper.com/datetime@perl.org) list, there is 30+ message thread about, “Which DOW if Day #1?”. But I swear everytime I see it, I think its the latest, calendar geek take on the “Which X are You?” meme. That might be the most boring one yet.
