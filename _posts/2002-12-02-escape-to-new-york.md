Going through another quiet spell. Probably has to do with being totally overwhelmed with:

- looking for housing – any leads on housing in and around Boston, particularly the Davis Sq. area is appreciated
- preparing a grant application to the [Open Society Institute](http://www.soros.org/) to fund IMC open editing tools
- preparing a presentation to [Five Colleges Inc](http://fivecolleges.edu), to convince them to reprise their role as first paying customer for the latest round of calendar software. they were the people who funded the original development of Calendrome, and made [Protest.net](http://www.protest.net) possible

Spent the week down in New York City. Learned that preparing Thanksgiving dinner in a kitchen that usually gets used for making coffee, and the occasional quesadilla is not a good idea.

Found out that a friend of a friend has spent 3 years trying to get accepted to the Army. I found that very sad and ironic. I tried to talk him out of it, but without success. (is there a way to represent that as [FOAF](http://rdfweb.org/foaf/)?)

Learned Bloomberg is trying to destory public transit, both [raising the fare to $2](http://www.straphangers.org/main.html), and continueing the policy of [hard balling transit workers](http://wsws.org/articles/2002/dec2002/nyc-d03.shtml). Discovered that my New York friends contain a surprisingly large percentage of unemployed philosophers from whom I learned of the [Unemployed Philosopher’s Guild](http://www.philosophersguild.com/), the only place you can buy [Will to Power bars](http://66.186.214.95/cgi-bin/ccp5/cp-app.cgi?usr=50X7867485&rnd=7072722&rrc=N&cip=24.60.209.90&pg=prod&ref=will&cat=food), [plush Freudian Slippers](http://66.186.214.95/cgi-bin/ccp5/cp-app.cgi?usr=50X8514199&rnd=3792842&rrc=N&cip=24.60.209.90&pg=prod&ref=slip&cat=freudiana), and a [Karl Marx beanie baby](http://66.186.214.95/cgi-bin/ccp5/cp-app.cgi?usr=50X7045570&rnd=3691899&rrc=N&cip=24.60.209.90&pg=prod&ref=marx&cat=Little%20Thinkers).

It was also one of those strange weeks, when everything you read seems to relate to each other.

*Ecology of Fear* takes a surprise swerve to talk about the “demonized Other”, feminized utopians, and Octavia Bulter, *Decoding Gender in SF*‘s bread and butter, who in turn is talking about Donna Haraway and her cyborgs, as discussed by D&amp;G in *1000 Plateaus* which is threatening to insert itselfs in my (re-)reading queue. (because as Calvino says, “One never reads the classics, only ever re-reads them”) Strange.
