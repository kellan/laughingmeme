Rafe is having a [bad MySQL day](http://rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=6685). There should be a word/phrase for that sense of frustration compounded with a certain helpless desperation that so quickly ferments into anger, rage, and sometimes blind hatred. I know that feeling well (see [Subversion, blargh](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002277.html#002277)), and I think it accounts for some of my most unbalanced moments from the last few years. Its something weâ€™re going to need to address as computing devices become more ubiquitous. (though I think **this** particularly manifestation is limited to software engineers)
