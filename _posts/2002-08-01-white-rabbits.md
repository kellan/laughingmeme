Odd, I always thought of the tradition of saying “White rabbits!”, on the first of each month as a family peculiarity, but apparently its part of a larger social phenomena, “Rabbit, rabbit”.

People talking about “rabbit rabbit”

- [AaronSW](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000457)
- who both referer to, [Harrumph’s dedicated Rabbit, Rabbit page](http://www.harrumph.com/rabbit/)
- and I just spotted [moreLikeThis](http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/02991) getting in on the act.

In our family the first person to say it in a given household was owed a small present or some other kindness. Living on the East coast allowed me to both be part of 2 households, and get the jump on my West coast family before they were fully awake.

I think I prefer “White rabbits”, to “Rabbit Rabbits”, but thats probably just a matter of familiarity.

Got to run, I’m supposed to be working at [Shakespeare Santa Cruz](http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org) in an hour, and I need a new pair of black pants.
