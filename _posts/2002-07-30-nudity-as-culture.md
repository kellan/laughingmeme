[mark](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/30.html#rules_of_etiquette_part_1) is talking about composing the wedding list for his upcoming wedding.

> This was actually one of the rules that we both independently stipulated when creating our guest list: no former boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands, lovers, flings, friends-with-benefits, whatever. **If we’ve seen you naked, find your own damn party.**

That got me thinking.

If I actually limited a party (or wedding reception) to people I’ve never seen naked, it would be a small, very lonely party, missing most of my nearest and dearest. Lets see… no one from high school – it was high school, and there was a large boarding component to it. Certainly no one from [Hampshire](http://www.hampshire.edu) – if nothing else skinny dipping in the resevoir was mandatory around the beginning and end of the school year. A handful of the people I’ve met recently, but thats more of a function of time and opportunity I suspect (and the number shurnk rapidly at Ruckus if for no other reason then there was a nice pond). I guess a handful of people from Palm and other jobs? But I’m not sure they would make the short list for a wedding recpetion anyways.

Maybe its a cultural difference?

Also: friends-with-benefits? New term to me, though the meaning is obvious. A quick [google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=friends-with-benefits) turns up 2,200 results, including the top result, [NC-17 Shirley Holmes fan fiction](http://www.budaclothing.com/shirley/creative/sunshine_best_friends.html). Now who is Shirely Holmes?
