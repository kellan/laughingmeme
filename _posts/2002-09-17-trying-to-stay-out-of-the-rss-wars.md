In the immortal words of Mark Pilgrim, [“He is, of course, kidding. At least I hope he’s kidding.”](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/09.html#quickly)

 He was referring to [Aaron’s RSS 3.0 spec](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000574), but I’m referring to [Mark’s &lt;blink&gt; suggestion](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/17.html#blink_and_youll_miss_it). Small, domain specific changes, are **why** we like namespaces. Have you considered perhaps using a &lt;link&gt; element with [DCMI Qualifier](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-qualifiers), Type=”Quirky”? (Type, used to categorize the nature or **genre** of the content of the resource.) And how you’ll write documentation for those of us born after the golden age of vinyl?

And do you pronounce it “bl![](http://cache.dictionary.com/dictionary/graphics/AHD4/GIF/ibreve.gif)ngk” or “b![](http://cache.dictionary.com/dictionary/graphics/AHD4/GIF/emacr.gif)-l![](http://cache.dictionary.com/dictionary/graphics/AHD4/GIF/ibreve.gif)ngk”?

 I can’t understand how some people (this is not directed at Mark) can on one hand argue for the simplification and clarification of RSS, and on the other hand support a format where tags get added willy-nilly. But if you are going to support such a format, can it at least include the stipulation, “If people want to add an element to RSS, then just send it to \[Aaron\] and \[he’ll\] add it to \[the\] list of all elements in use.”

….but if I was going to get involved, I might point out that Morbus need to work on his sense of humor, I’ve thought this ever since he [joked about shooting his girlfriend](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/2352), while Dave has [serious](http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml) [anger](http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/sept00/0268.html)[issues](< http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1744#monsters>), but Bill has always been great the few times I’ve corresponded with him.
