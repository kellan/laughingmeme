I noticed this morning that Magpie just crossed the 20,000 downloads threshold (yay for Sourceforge RSS), including 10,000 downloads in the last 6 months. Even more telling is the real explosion of interesting new services, articles, and projects all using Mapgie. (I’m trying to keep track of some of this [Magpie links](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/links.shtml) page, and some it on [del.icio.us/tag/magpie](http://del.icio.us/tag/magpie) which is syndicated to the [Magpie blog](http://laughingmeme.org/magpie_blog/))

With Steve’s [recent work](http://minutillo.com/steve/weblog/2004/6/17/php-xml-and-character-encodings-a-tale-of-sadness-rage-and-data-loss) we might finally kill the encoding issues which has plagued Mapgie since day one (anyone want to volunteer to come kill the encoding issues plaguing XML::RSS?).

And perhaps most surprising to me was a copy of [Uncommon Grounds](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465036317/102-9435059-1111327?v=glance) showing up at my door this weekend apparently purchased from my Amazon wishlist. (which I had forgotten I had, and to the best of my knowledge have never linked to, and is horribly out of date) Wow. This looks like a great book. Thank you.

And thanks to everyone who has been participating so far.
