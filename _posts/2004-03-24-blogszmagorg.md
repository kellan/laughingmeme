[Zmag](http://www.zmag.org/) is [getting into the blogging](http://blogs.zmag.org). Something about this seems strange to me, but I’m not sure what, its not as if Z has failed to embrace technology, their Z Sustainers program is the best example I can think of of an old media organization embracing new media in creative ways. Maybe I’ll be more articulate in the morning. (not likely)
