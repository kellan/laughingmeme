I’ll be in SF next week (Feb 21st – 24th), and a couple of days the following week. I’ll be at [Groupware SF Tech Session](http://sftechsessions.com/2006/02/groupware/), but won’t be at [Mashup Camp](http://www.mashupcamp.com/)(have fun all!) So if we’ve been meaning to catch up, next week looks good.
