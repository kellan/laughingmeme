While BitTorrent worked great, FireBird itself is badly broken. It works fine for browsing, but if you click on a link from an external app (e.g. NetNewsWire, or LaunchBar) then you get “XML Parsing Error: undefined entity”.

Apparently this is tied to [the wrong theme being loaded](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206936). But whatever the issue, makes the browser useless to me. Blah.
