You know the one persistent meme in all these RSS debates is that RSS 1.0 is somehow a “RDF technology” and therefore complicated and hard. I never understood that. I’ll be the first to admit I don’t entirely grok the RDF/Semantic Web big picture, and even less the processing model for working with RDF, but so what. RSS 1.0 is just XML, how its hard to parse, or hard to produce I can’t imagine. At one point in the debate RSS 1.0 was supposedly difficult because of the namespaces, and I grant you that supporting namespaces well is harder then not supporting them. But if someone could explain to me what makes RSS 1.0 harder then RSS 2.0 I would dearly love to know.
