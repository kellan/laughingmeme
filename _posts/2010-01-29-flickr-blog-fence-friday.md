Twitter has \[#followfriday\](http://twitter.com/#search?q=followfriday). If I were ever to rebuild Flickr from the ground up, Iâ€™d collapse the distinction between tags and groups for thematic collaboration. Explicit grouping is useful only when you need to create a sense of place, a trick most easily accomplished in virtual environment by articulating a membership, and a history. Collaboration does not need place, it needs energy.
