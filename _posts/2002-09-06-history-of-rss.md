diveintomark, has a very nice [abridged history of RSS](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/06.html#history_of_the_rss_fork), sort of an ethnography really. A much cleaner history really, then my own attempt, [A Personal History of RSS](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/cat_rss.html#000004), but then I was trying to pitch RSS to XML phobes, so I had a different goal. What I can’t understand is why anyone pays attention to Dave Winer at all. I haven’t used Radio, so maybe its just so brilliant you think the man must be a genius, but in his dealings with RSS his design instincts have been ugly and wrong, and his communication style would get him booted from my most civil society. And trying to trademark RSS was just underhanded. In the end [AaronSW](http://www.aaronsw.com) was right, people use tools to generate RSS, and parse it, and re-display it, and there is a stable of excellent tools available. So why does this debate still raging?
