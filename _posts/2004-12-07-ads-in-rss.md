Kottke did some footwork and got some great response from [major aggregator developers regarding ads in RSS](http://www.kottke.org/04/12/blocking-rss-advertising). I thought Brent’s comments that it isn’t about ad blocking as much as importance and attention managment are particularily right on the money. But in particular I thought I’d call out [this comment](http://www.kottke.org/04/12/blocking-rss-advertising#17118):

> The only ads in feeds I have recieved so far have been google adsense ads – and since I use [Feed On Feeds](http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/) and a [userContent.css](http://www.floppymoose.com/) file that blocks those ads, I don’t see them anyway.

Nice.
