Love this quote from Borthwick regarding news.me and shipping:

> *“I ran a new product development group within a large company and I would like to dispel the simplistic myth that big companies don’t innovate. There is innovation occurring at many big companies. The thing that big companies really struggle to do is to ship.”* – [John Borthwick – news.me](http://www.borthwick.com/weblog/2011/02/21/news-me/)

People ask me why I focus so [relentlessly on shipping](http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/5498159787/) as opposed to the rest of the software development life cycle. In part because it’s hard. It’s often **the hard problem**. And it gets harder the longer you do it, aka it gets harder the more important the thing you’ve built is.
