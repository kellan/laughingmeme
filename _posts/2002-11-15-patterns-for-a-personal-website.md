[Patterns for a Personal Website](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/index.html) is one of the coolest, most useful pages I’ve found in a long time. Its amazingly informative, thought provoking (if you care about the web), and a beautiful example of good information architecture.

### Whats a pattern?

A pattern is a literary form. Its a way of talking about recurring problems, and their solutions. They are a language for sharing insights. Popularized by GoF’s book, Design Patterns, they are most commonly discussed in the context of software design, but have clearly spread beyond that with this site, now including to web usability, and information design. See [PPW’s intro](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/introduction.html) for more info.

### Some example patterns

- [DeepContent](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/deep.content.html) (a [Content Pattern](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/index.html#contentpatterns))  
    One of the rarest and most exciting patterns in the blog community, the given example is Mark Rosenfelder’s [Language Construction Kit](http://www.zompist.com/kit.html).
- [Downloadable Weblet](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/downloadable.weblet.html) (a [Technology Pattern](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/index.html#technologypatterns))   
    A cool idea I’ve never thought of. If a piece of your site is of Appropiate Length, consider bundling it for download.
