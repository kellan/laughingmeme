FYI, I’m back in Seattle for the next 2+ weeks, so if I stood you up in December due to my generally hectic and distracting moving across the country thing, I promise I’m (marginally) more organized and reliable now. I will almost certainly **not** be making it to SF for [FLOSS Usability](http://www.flossusability.org/) (having recently switched to a [Reach accessibility approach](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000554.php)), but might make it to Portland, assumings [c@ts](http://cats.protest.net) is on for the end of this month.
