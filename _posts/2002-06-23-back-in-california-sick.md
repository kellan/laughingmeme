I’m slowly starting to dig myself out of the hole of having been travelling for nearly 2 months, being mostly offline for the last 10 days, seeing my girlfriend, and being sick. Procmail let over 500 messages pile up in my inbox. I’m supposed to be heading up to [Ruckus Camp](http://ruckus.org/techcamp.html) tomorrow and I haven’t even figure out how I’m getting there, much less what I’m teaching. I’m considering brewing a big pot of coffee, closing the door, finishing finally finishing [Invisible Cities](http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020622-42082444.htm) [[2]](http://www.booksense.com/product/info.jsp?isbn=0156453800), [The Years of Rice and Salt](http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2002/03/06/europe/) [[2]](http://www.booksense.com/product/info.jsp?isbn=0553109200), and [The Bourne Identity](http://www.booksense.com/product/info.jsp?isbn=0553584596).
