### Slouching towards release, part 2

Also, I released [MagpieRSS 0.4](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55691&release_id=134850) today. - New and better error handling. Its not very PHP like, but its rationale, and flexible, and designed to be used as part of a larger application. (like I said, not very PHP like)
- more and better examples on how to use Magpie, including how to use it with [Smarty](http://smarty.php.net)
- Ships with a custom Smarty plugin for parsing RSS dates so you can include in your templates the nifty construct: > `$item.dc.date|rss_date_parse|date_format:"%A, %B %e, %Y"}`

[Download Mapie 0.4](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55691&release_id=134850).
