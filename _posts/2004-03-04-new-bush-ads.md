Bush has launched a new series of [TV ads](http://www.georgewbush.com/tvads/) which have alternately been described as an “outrageous attempt to use tragedy to score political points”, “using our dead relatives as a springboard for his campaign”, and “his only message seems to be ‘its not my fault’.”

However I can’t comment, as the ads are only available as Windows Media files. Just in case you needed another reason not to like the man.
