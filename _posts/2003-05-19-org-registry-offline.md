According to The Register [PIRâ€™s .org registry has broken down](http://theregister.co.uk/content/6/30760.html)(The Reg has been a little shakey on facts lately so take with pinch of salt)

Umm, why does this [come as no surprise](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000080.html).

Looks like this time it [might be a false alarm](http://icann.blog.us/2003/05/19.html#a1356).
