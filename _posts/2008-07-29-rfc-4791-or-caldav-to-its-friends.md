\[CalDAV\](http://ietf.osafoundation.org/caldav/) is now available from \[Google Calendar\](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358) and \[Zimbra\](http://www.hawkwings.net/2008/01/17/zimbra-gets-friendly-with-safari-30-iphone/).

At times I’ve \[been CalDAV’s biggest fan\](http://laughingmeme.org/?s=caldav). A calendaring protocol which **finally** stopped actively pretending the Web didn’t exist (I’m looking at you IETF CalSch WG)! But it does seem like its been a hard slog to implement. Keeping my fingers crossed for the future.

(pointed out to me that merely because **I** found out about Zimbra’s CalDAV support last week at OSCON, doesn’t mean it hasn’t been available since January, mea culpa)
