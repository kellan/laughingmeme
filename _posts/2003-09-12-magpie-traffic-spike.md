The most frustrating part of hosting a site with [Sourceforge](http://sf.net) (except maybe when they screw up, the uploading for your public key, and lock you out of CVS for 3 months) is not being able to get accurate logs. The download, page view statistics seem to be working again after months of severe under reporting. However, you still canâ€™t get referer info, so you have no idea as to **how** people are finding your project. (And whether they found what they were looking for).

For example, traffic tripled, and downloads doubled for [Magpie](http://magpierss.sf.net) on Wednesday, but I have no idea why.
