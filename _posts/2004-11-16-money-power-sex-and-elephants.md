Picked up my copy of Lakoff’s [Don’t Think of an Elephant](http://www.chelseagreen.com/2004/items/elephant) this evening, and I noticed that it is published by [Chelsea Green](http://www.chelseagreen.com). Chelsea Green is a progressive publishing house in Vermont who use [Eggplant’s](http://eggplant.coop) <acronym title="Ministry of Information">MI</acronym> CMS. A CMS based on the Riot::Core framework we built for our since stalled [protest.net](http://protest.net) re-write. Small world.

While I was there I also noticed that they’re totally sold out of “Don’t Think”, so now would probably be a good time to buy your copy before your local bookstore also runs out.
