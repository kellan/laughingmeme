We’ve finally released a stable version of [XML::RSS](http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS) (version 1.00 was short lived as it broke a bunch of my scripts for [Global IMC](http://www.indymedia.org))

- Fixed XML::RSS’s nasty habit of unescaping entities and not re-escaping then, now all XML it generates is properly encoded.
- Added limited support for parsing attribute based modules, like mod*admin, still not sufficient for mod*link.
- Fixed some really poor assumptions about the structure of RSS files.
- Generate RSS 2.0
- See [Changes](http://search.cpan.org/src/BDFOY/XML-RSS-1.01/Changes) for more.
