Robin’s [recent response](http://www.ambiguous.org/archive.php3/2003/04/22#robin2003422.1) to the Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania [“mouthing off about homosexuality”](http://www.advocate.com/new_news.asp?id=8409&sd=04/22/03) and his earlier [response to the Supreme court ruling on Texas’s anti-sodomy laws](http://www.ambiguous.org/archive.php3/2003/03/28#robin2003328.3) are very interesting. One of the few things I’ve read recently that really rearranged my thoughts on an issue, the sort of thing that when you reach the end of the piece it seems obvious, but it sure didn’t before you started reading.

That people, given the right to marry whatever sex they like, will then want the right to marry whatever number they like, with whatever rules they like–to arrange their own families the way they want to. That the people will want that freedom to shape their own lives.
