I finally got a chance to play with [DateTime.pm](http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime/) tonight. Its the manifestation of a several year long campaign first started by the [Reefknot](http://reefknot.sf.net) folks, to get Perl a standard Date and Time module. (as opposed to the 50+ conflicting, and overlapping solutions we have now)

Initial work that [autarch](http://use.perl.org/~autarch/) (aka Dave Rolsky of [Mason](http://masonhq.com), and [Alzabo](http://alzabo.sf.net) fame) has done is amazing! Its a rationale, clean, api to date manipulation, thats easy to building on top of ([Matts](http://use.perl.org/~Matts/) has gutted his popular [Time::Piece](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Time-Piece/), and turned it into to a [DateTime wrapper](http://use.perl.org/~Matts/journal/10506)), has support (or at least hooks) for internationalization, and the most comprehensive timezone support Iâ€™ve ever seen. (they even support floating timezones!)

That said, its definitely pre-release, and I ran into a few bugs tonight, mostly relating to timezones which are offsets rather then named. (which are the kind I was working with as I was playing with RSS and that means [W3CDTF](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)) Patches are in the [mail](http://archive.develooper.com/datetime@perl.org/).

Yeah!
