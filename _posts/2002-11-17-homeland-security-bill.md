WSWS has an excellent article on the [establishing, for the first time in US history, a centralized federal internal security agency](http://wsws.org/articles/2002/nov2002/home-n18.shtml), the legislative farce being used to ram it through the legislature.

And from the mainstream, William Safireâ€™s, [You Are a Suspect](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/14/opinion/14SAFI.html) is a chilling scare piece about the legislation. If establishment, rich white man William Safire is scared, how should you and I feel?

NPR also had a nice interview with a Senator whose name escaped me complaining bitterly about being given only 48 hours to review, and 30 hours to debate a 484 page law of sweeping magnitude.(one that was only 35 pages before it hit House comittees) (sorry no link)
