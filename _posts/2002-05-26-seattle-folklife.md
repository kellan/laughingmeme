I arrived to Seattle FolkLife last yesterday, not really understanding what it was. I wandered through the throngs enjoying the buskers, and performance, and was utterly surprised when someone asked me if I had seen any of the sponsored performances. You mean there is something more then hundreds of buskers descending on a field? Apparently there was, but I missed it.

What I did see

- 2 young teenagers, whose Beattle covers were soso, but whose stage patter more then made up for it. Inciting the crowd to louder and louder cheers, until they probably had 200 people, drawn by the noise, listening to their quiet little rendition of “Love you baby.”
- What must have been the world’s only Casey Neill cover band. (unfortunately they did not play, “Naked Underneath Your Clothes”, but it probably wasn’t the right audience.
- An accordion player, who told us that he loved the end of the day at folklife, because he always lost his voice. When asked why this was good, he explained that it makes doing Tom Waits impressions easier.
- An amazing demostration of capoeira, that went on and on, with a whole school (including 5 years olds) flowing in and out of the dance. Beautiful. I stood there and watched for 30 minutes.
- Two hundred people trying to learn to belly dance.
- Lots more.
