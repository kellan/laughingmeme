### diveintomark

Mark is back from his near month long hiatus, and on fire. [newdoor](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/11/20.html#new_reading) – is an aggregator that learns using seed data from [Blogging Ecosystem](http://www.myelin.co.nz/ecosystem/). Usable agents, and the promise of webservices in one fell swoop.

He is also talking about how hard it is [being perfect](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1037595583&count=1), and the [traps of XHTML 1.1](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/11/21.html#a_warning_to_others).

### Shirky

Over at the boingboing guest blog, Clay Shirky has also been on fire. Continueing the theme of group forming found in new door, Shirky hilights seminal documents in 3 online communities (LambdaMOO, Slashdot, and Wikipedia), in his post [Morning constitutional](http://boingboing.net/text/2002_11_17_guestbar.html)(scroll down), links to work on [developing a social rhetoric](http://interconnected.org/home/2002_11_17_archive.shtml#85692756), and links to the oldie, but still relevant, [The Tyranny of Structurelessness](http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/structurelessness.html).

### Online Organizing Sucks

I’ve got **lots** of links, ideas, and rants about group forming, online organizing, and managing discussions all bubbling inside my head right now. No time to blog them. Hopefully soon.
