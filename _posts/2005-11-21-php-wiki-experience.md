Thought I’d check to see if anyone has any experience with the PHP wiki offerings, especially \[DokuWiki\]\[doku\], or \[PmWiki\](http://www.pmwiki.org/)?

I’m looking for something suitable for building out a FAQ, and docs site for Magpie. I’m disinclined towards \[MediaWiki\](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) because I’ve found \[Kwiki’s\](http://kwiki.org/) approach of using the filesystem for data storage a plus, and because I don’t anticipate a need for MathML support, or other such esoterica.

Currently leaning towards \[DokuWiki\]\[doku\] partially on the suggestive nature of the name (sounds like “documentation”), and partially on \[Harry’s 2004 SitePoint review\](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2004/10/11/pick-of-the-wikis-dokuwiki/). Possibly supplemented by \[Bamboo\](http://dev.riseup.net/bamboo/), which is a lot like a \[Hieraki\](http://www.hieraki.org/trac/) for PHP.

Praise, disagreement, experiences, resources?
