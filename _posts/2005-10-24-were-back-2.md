After an **extended** downtime, [LaughingMeme](http://laughingmeme.org) is back. Having gone from [MT 2.6][mt] to [Wordpress 1.5.2](http://wordpress.org) to [MT 3.2][mt] to [Typo 2.5.6][typo] and now to [Typo 2.0.6][typo] it was a decidely silly journey.

And while a number of things are still broken, I feel like its starting to take shape, and [Typo][typo]/[Rails](http://rubyonrails.com) as an infinitely hackable framework gives me the chance to play with ideas I’ve been mulling over for a while, on how to present and reference the growing archives we all have. (only the skeleton of which is yet showing)

**update:** Comments fixed, again. (thanks [Ruby](http://lotusmedia.org) for the heads up)

**update2:** My CSS-fu isn’t up to it (or perhaps my concentration is just shot right now), but the original artistic vision called for the [magpie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed*magpie) to float \_behind* the MLPs. (ideally blurred slightly by a translucency) Anyone able to help?
