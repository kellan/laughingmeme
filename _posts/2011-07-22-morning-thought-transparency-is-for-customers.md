If a service shares data transparently with you, there’s a good chance you’re the customer, otherwise you’re probably the product.

Just another reason I’ve always been impressed by the Etsy tradition of [Weather Reports](http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/?s=weather+report), and why I’m psyched about the [Shop Stats](http://www.etsy.com/teams/7716/announcements/discuss/8727235/page/1/) ([screenshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kellan/5963557833/)) launch yesterday.
