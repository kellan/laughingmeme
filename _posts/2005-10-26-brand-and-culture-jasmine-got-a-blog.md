So much happened in the last 3 weeks while you’ve been deprived of my piercing insights, its hard to know where to begin catching up.

To me the most exciting news is that Jasmine now has a blog, \[brandxculture\](http://brandxculture.com/blog/) (pronounced \[‘brand and culture’\](http://brandxculture.com/blog/)). Truth be told she has had it for a while, but only recently officially launched it.

My favorite posts so far are

- \[Perish or Thrive\](http://brandxculture.com/blog/2005/09/perish-or-thrive.html)
- \[Granny’s revival\](http://brandxculture.com/blog/2005/09/grannys-revival.html)
- \[Brands are like personalities\](http://brandxculture.com/blog/2005/08/brands-are-like-personalities.html)
