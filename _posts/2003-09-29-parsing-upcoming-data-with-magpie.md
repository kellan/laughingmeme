idly.org: [With a lot of help from Magpie RSS, I have whipped up a personal listing page of events from Upcoming.org.](http://www.idly.org/2003/09/27/extracting_upcomingorg_data.php "i d l y . o r g :: Extracting Upcoming.org Data")

Cool!

After all parsing event bearing RSS is what Magpie was original written for (even if they aren’t using Magpie’s [W3CDTF](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) parsing)
