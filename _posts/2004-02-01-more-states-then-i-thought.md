I always think I haven’t been to most states, I take some perverse pride is ignoring large swathes of my country. However when I sat down and check them off, I’d been to more then I expected. (though much of that is the [long, horizontal line](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000195.html) running from from coast to coast down the center of the country that marks Josh and my drive back from California 2 years ago)

### Where In the World?

Conversly I feel like I’ve put a fair amount of ground under my boots travelling the world, and yet look what a small dent my travels have put in it all. ![](http://www.world66.com/myworld66/visitedCountries/colormap?visited=AUBECAFRDEITJPLSMYMAMZNLPRZAESCHTHTNUSVAZMZW)
