You hear actors dither about being typecast, and how its a bad career move. As a programmer should you worry? I think I’m dangerously close to getting typecast as an “RSS developer”. I mean, here I am \[trying to give away XML::RSS\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002913.html#002913), and I’m getting IMs, “Um, could you write a feed poller for us?”

I can do more! I promise! Just give me a chance. Ah well, we all have our crosses we bear. (and it could be worse, I mean imagine being the memory leak guy who got all the memory leak bugs)
