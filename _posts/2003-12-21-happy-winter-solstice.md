A few hours closer to the equator then I was last week, Solstice doesnâ€™t quite have the same impact as in Seattle where it felt as if the Sun was about to flicker and go out. Still we ran out to explore the muddy hills of Soquel and appreciate the days few precious wintery hours of sunlight. Warmly back at home the tea, and eggnog are poured, and the lebkuchen which was made a month ago is finally ready. The minutes tick down until this crazy top starts to tip back towards the warmth, and Aragorn is somewhere in the background fighting orcs in anticipation of our Xmas morning trip to the cinema to see Return of the King.

Happy holidays.
