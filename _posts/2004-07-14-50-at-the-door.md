[$50 to get in the door of the IMC](https://secure.mediajumpstart.net/orgs/nycgrassrootsmedia.org/mediaspace/?p=register "NYC Independent Media Convergence Space") during the Republican National Convention?!?!

I’m not on the ground in New York so I can only speculate on what they are thinking, but I have serious doubt about whether the terms “convergence space”, “Indymedia”, or even “independent” should really ever appear on a page that talks about a $50 registration fee. I don’t usually take a hard line on what is, and isn’t IMC, but that is the least IMC sounding thing I think I’ve ever heard.

In fact that only thing that could make it sound less like any IMC I’ve ever been part of is if you couldn’t store your stuff there, or pass out at 2am after 22 hours of straight hacking. Oh wait
