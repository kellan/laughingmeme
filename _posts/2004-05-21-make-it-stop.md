Sitting here among a rat’s nest of cables, and the desiccated husks of two servers that represent a significant portion of the my work since Wednesday, I feel I have reaffirmed that I was not meant to be a sysadmin.

Part of the appeal of programming is the problem solving aspects of it, but I realize that a key component, for me at least, is the creativity. Conversely, system administration seems to be pure programming (or perhaps I just lack the creative spark). After 3 days of programming I would have brought something new and different into the world. Wednesday morning there were two working servers, now 3 days later there is 1. Hard to see the accomplishment.

Apropos of this all, I’d like to say thank you to:

- Josh, sysadmin extraordinaire
- [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.org/), a vision of how Linux should work
- all sysadmins everywhere

And [July 30th is Sysadmin appreciation day](http://www.sysadminday.com/)
