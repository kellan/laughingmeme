Is the gasmask a symbolic marker in the discourse of a people under seige by their own government’s oppressive militarized police force? Does its dual role as protective garment, and mask cloak the wearer in a protected anonymity? Acknowlegde the toxcitiy of our modern environment, metaphorically and actually? Transform the wearer from familiar to alien? Bubble up from the collective nightmare of the ceaseless barage of tear gas, April 2001, in nearby [Quebec City](http://monkeyfist.com/quebec_photos/)? Just look cool?

Aaron’s documentation of Montreal [gorgeous street art](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2003/09/23/5234/) seems to be turning up a lot of [gas masks](http://aaronland.info/weblog/2003/12/04/5326/).
