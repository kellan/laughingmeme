I’ll be attending the [BostonPHP user group](http://www.bostonphp.org/)/[Boston PHP meetup](http://php.meetup.com/) this Thursday (Jan 6th), at 7:30pm, at [Neptune Web](http://www.neptuneweb.com/) (in Davis Sq.). (and I’ll try to play nice with the Red Hat users who apparently will [also be attending](http://redhat.meetup.com/25/))

p.s. note that the topic, “customizing phpBB” isn’t the most fascinating ever, I’m going for the meetup aspects.
