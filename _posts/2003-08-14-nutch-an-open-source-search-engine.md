You probably saw the [Slashdot story](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/13/191225&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=185&tid=95) on [Nutch](http://www.nutch.org), and if, like me, you’re bored and annoyed by Slashdot ignored it.

A few pieces of info that make Nutch more interesting:

- [Doug Cutting](http://lucene.sourceforge.net/publications.html), one of the leading, and most innovative search engine hackers, the man behind both [VTwin](http://www.research.apple.com/research/tech/V-Twin/default.html) and [Lucene](http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html) is the main hacker on Nutch
- Almost a [year of active development](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=12036) has already gone into this
- Tim O’Reilly, and Mitch Kapor (and Doug Cutting) [are on the board.](http://www.nutch.org/docs/org.html)

Making ones biases public is a one of the key ideas behind the IMC open publishing movement, so I’m thrilled by the idea of an open source search engine. But what is with the crappy name?

I might have to add an ngo/npo technology category.
