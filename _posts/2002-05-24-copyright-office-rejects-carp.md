[MediaGeek](http://www.mediageek.org) is linking to coverage of [Copyright Office Rejects CARP](http://www.mediageek.org/2002_05_01_archive_index.html#85107864).

Bankruptcy courts would have flooded, and much of web radio would have disappeared (though probably talking head political webradio would still be flourishing) as the proposal included a clause to allow for massive fees to be collected retoactively back to 1998.
