Took the bike out for a spin on what might be the last truly hot and sunny weekend of the year.

Head out in search of the fabled [Red Hook ball field food vendors](http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-ball-fields-brooklyn). For 30 years they’ve been congregating on the weekends in Red Hook to feed the hordes who show up to play and watch soccer. And its widely agreed to be the best Mexican and Latin American food in the 5 boroughs.

Last year they had a brush with extinction as the city, in its bid to clean up the neighborhood and make it yuppy/Ikea safe shut down the proceedings citing sanitation issues. Eventually a compromise was struck, and a handful of the vendors are back, now in plumbed trucks. The food is still very very good, but their numbers are reduced. My favorite was the pupusas [loroco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loroco) con queso.

But even before that a flat tire drove me into the [The Bike Shop](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bike-shop-brooklyn) and the [Coffee Den](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-coffee-den-brooklyn) across the way, where they serve a decent cup of Gorilla. Need to get those kevlar tires.

From there we walked along the water front, dramatically changed from our last visit two years ago. And found to our glee that [Steve’s](http://www.keylime.com/home.html) was still serving their swingles, frozen chocolate dipped key lime pie on a stick.

On the ride back I wandered into [Fort Greene park](http://www.fortgreenepark.org/), and wondered if I’d found a portal back to Dolores Park. So startled I forgot to take a photo.

And then, at the end of the 13 mile loop, blocks from home, tripped over a fafi and Koralie piece, paint not quite dry.
