[CafeSpot](http://cafespot.net/index.html "CafeSpot"), is a tagging based cafe guide written in Lisp

> CafeSpot, a social guide to independent cafes, coffee shops, restaurants and more.

So the obvious question is, how does this project benefit from and share data with other projects like \[Delocator\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002912.html) or \[WifiMug\](http://wifimug.org)?

Someone should *really* get together and coordinate a data interchange format/protocol/consensus.
