![](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/albums/orcas2003/IMG_1047.thumb.jpg)Yesterday Seattle was rocked by the blizzard of the century, as nearly 6 inches of snow were dumped upon the city (its been a pretty short century so far), but that isn’t the snow I’m talking about.

Last week Jasmine and I caught the breath taking ferry ride from Anacortes to Orcas Island in the San Juans. We spent almost exactly 24 hours on the island, but if time had allowed, would gladly have stayed the week. Our first day over was crisp, and clear, the air so clean and fresh everything seemed to gleam. I tried to capture it on film, but alas my camera seemed unsusceptible to the glory of the day. ![](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/albums/orcas2003/IMG_0974_001.thumb.jpg)The snow clouds rolled in over night, and the second day was one of quiet, a muffled peace laying on the land.
