I’ve been hearing good things about the [Renewing Anarchist Tradition](http://www.homemadejam.org/renew/) for a couple of years. Held at the [ISE](http://www.social-ecology.org/) in Plainfield, VT, perhaps the closest thing the radical left has to a think tank, but also a center for education, sharing, social organzing, and the roots of the puppet movment. And finally I’m going to be in the country, and on the correct side of the coast when it happens.

These sort of events are critical for maintaing the dialogue and memory in the anarchist community, an idea with a long long history, that has somehow gotten linked with youth culture. A history perhaps embodies in [Murray Bookchin](http://www.social-ecology.org/about/faculty/bookchin.html) and his historical clashes with the punk anarchist tradition.

So they are intellectual powerhouse of community organizing, and I know for a fact that they have strong web talent available to them, as some of the memebers of [Eggplant](http://www.eggplantmedia.com) are linked with the ISE. So why is the conference website 3 months out of date on the eve of the conference?

FInally, you know you’re doing good work when you draw as much vitrol from the “[fake public interest site called ActivistCash.com](http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,723899,00.html)” as the ISE does.(I would link to the entry, but I’m getting a 500 error)
