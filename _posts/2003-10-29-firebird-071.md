I love open source. After I had [my problems with Firebird 0.7.0](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001319.html), I went to [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) like a good open source user, and wrote a bug entry. Several days later my problem was solved and I’ve been running the nightly ever since.

Now 2 weeks later, [Firebird 0.7.1](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/0.7.1-release-notes.html) is out, containing 4 major bug fixes, plus speed enhancements, Panther compatibility enhancements, and a couple of features. Compare that to IE where you’ll have to wait until 2006, to find out if they’ve fixed your bug.
