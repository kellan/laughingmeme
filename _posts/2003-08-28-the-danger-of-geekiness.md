I was stumped while trying to sign up for Apple’s new online store. When I saw the new item in the source panel of iTunes “Music Store”, I read that as a place where music is stored, maybe an update to the library? After all I just had spent the last hour talking about setting up [Cyrus](http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/) as a local mail store, and I certainly didn’t mean as a website to buy old emails.
