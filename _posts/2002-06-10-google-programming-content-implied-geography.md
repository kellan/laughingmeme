Somehow it slipped by me, but the winner of [Google Programming Contest](http://www.google.com/programming-contest/) has [been announced.](http://www.google.com/programming-contest/winner.html)

> Daniel’s project adds the ability to search for web pages within a particular geographic locale.

He parses street addresses, discovered on web pages, into latitude/longitude using [TIGER](http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/) and [FIPS](http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/55new/nav-top-fr.htm)and attaches that info as meta-data to the documents. **Thats brilliant!** Google is built on the ideas that people through the normal business of web building create a rich source of metainformation, and this is a continuation of that basic insight/philosophy.  
This is the rejoinder to [Cory Doctrow’s](http://boingboing.net) argument [Metacrap, people suck at metadata](http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm).  
People only suck at metadata if they know they are building it.

In some ways it reminds me of the work we were talking about at MetaEvents, and then Anyday.com/Palm of building tools to parse data about events out of the general data stream. Useful for an event based search engine or a [bookmarklet](http://www.bookmarklets.com/) to grab events out of a web page, and add them to your *World’s Best Online PIM.* [CIIR](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/) was working on this back in 1998, [rabble](http://anarchogeek.com) and I dreamed of getting our hands on it, when we shared an office with them, but it was one of their [DARPA](http://www.darpa.mil/) projects, so if they got anywhere with it, we’re not likely to hear about it. ![:(](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png)
