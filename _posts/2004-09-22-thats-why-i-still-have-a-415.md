Some days I feel the drain of my relatively nomadic existence. it isn’t so much that I don’t have roots (buried deep in the warm California soil), but that I’ve wandered far and frequently. Exhaustion and perhaps the slight sting of exasperated scorn from peers embedded deeply in their long term acts of radical transformation and network building.

So its a bit of relief, a breath of fresh air blowing playfully across the global telecommunication infrastructure when a fellow traveler reaches out across time and space.

For example when a house mate from Providence (’03) calls from Miami on their New York (’01) cell phone, and reaches you, in Seattle, on your San Francisco (’02) number.

The social connection and the cellphone constants providing an anchor for a persistent virtual space in a fluid, and rapidly fluctuating world.
