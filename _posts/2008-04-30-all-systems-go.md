Skipped lunch to spend a couple of hours this afternoon hanging at \[Mojo cafe\](http://www.mojobicyclecafe.com/) this afternoon with \[Mroth\](http://mroth.info) and \[Blaine\](http://romeda.org) getting trained up by \[Steve\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogmilque/). Love this photo Mroth snapped.
