I’m going through an interesting life/work phase (dear god, let it be a phase), where I seem to be able to spend all day on the phone/email and still not talk with half the people I’m supposed to talk with. Exhausting, how do power communicators, though professionally highly connected nodes, do it?

But today, “Today!”, he says, “We write code!” (having just finished off a coder’s breakfast of a bagel, lots of egg and cheese [coding has high protein requirements], and a pot of coffee)

Today’s thought: <cite>[It’s all spinning wheels and self doubt until the first pot of coffee.](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/03/07/quickorama)</cite>
