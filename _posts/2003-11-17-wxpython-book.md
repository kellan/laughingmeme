[Speaking of tech books](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001396.html#001396), I would queue outside the warehouse of any publisher who brought out a half way decent book on [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/). Add a chapter on [Chandler](http://www.osafoundation.org/index.htm) hacking, and I might go all fannish, and show up for the queue in costume.
