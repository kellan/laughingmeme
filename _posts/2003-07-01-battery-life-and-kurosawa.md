People ask me how the battery life is on my new G4 powerbook. I havenâ€™t timed it, except to know its a dream, especially after years of having a laptop without a battery.

I did come up with a handy metric last night though, not quite long enough to watch [7 Samurai](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0047478) on battery alone.
