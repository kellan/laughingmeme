Someone should pry Amazon open to start licensing the Kindle so an ecosystem of readers can bloom. You’ll notice the below image is patently false, looking over this limited range of reading options presented as a plethora there is a key accessibility challenge: none of them are suitable for that important reading venue, the bathtub. This was brought home to me this weekend as I managed to throw out my back last week and have been doing some long soaks and all of a sudden none of the books I’m currently reading were available. A travesty, and a tragedy of closed platforms.
