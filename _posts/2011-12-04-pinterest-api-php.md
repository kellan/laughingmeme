Last March [Jasmine](http://twitter.com/curlyjazz) started talking to me about Pinterest in terms that made me pay attention. Since then I’ve been keeping an eye on it. A few weeks ago I decided to “cheat” my way into participation by writing a quick script to [sync my Etsy favorites to a board](http://pinterest.com/kellan/etsy-favorites/).

Per request, I just pushed [my PHP library for the unofficial Pinterest API](https://github.com/kellan/pinterest.api.php) up to Github. It’s a simple thing, more suitable for forking then using as is, and with some serious gaps where I simply haven’t had the time to find (assuming they exist) API methods for simulating the “pinmarklet” (as opposed to uploading), and for backing up pins.
