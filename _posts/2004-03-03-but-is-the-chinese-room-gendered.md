[Steve](http://minutillo.com/steve/) is exploring the ever fertile [intersection of linguistics and programming](http://minutillo.com/steve/weblog/2004/3/3/20182).

> When there’s a mismatch, like “I was talking to my sister today, and ….. Then he said…”, some sort of exception is raised, and a flag gets set that says my subject table is corrupted. It’s kind of like a parity mismatch: the pointers to the subjects are possibly all wrong. It takes a few neuro-cycles for the error to be caught and passed up to the higher brain functions, which eventually decide that this error is safe to ignore. But by then the parsing, which was halted, is a bit behind, and the lexer’s buffer may have overrun.

Programming is just linguistics for people who are frustrated by natural language’s lack of O’Reilly books.
