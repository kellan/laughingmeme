At least here in Jamaica Plain I was counting 30-40 lightning strikes a minute, we had strikes in our backyard, the thunder sounded like the end of the world, and it all went on for at least an hour.  \n\nImpressive and a bit scary, never seen anything like it."

Okay, blogging about the weather is almost as bad as blogging about cats, but was anyone else woken by last nightâ€™s storm? At least here in Jamaica Plain I was counting 30-40 lightning strikes a minute, we had strikes in our backyard, the thunder sounded like the end of the world, and it all went on for at least an hour.

Impressive and a bit scary, never seen anything like it.
