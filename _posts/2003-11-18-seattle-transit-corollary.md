So I’ve talked a number of peoples’ ears off about how excellent I think the [Seattle’s bus system](http://transit.metrokc.gov) is, especially their nifty online trip planner, but also in terms of service and timeliness.

The exception to this of course is….when it’s raining! When seemingly without warning you should expect 40 minute delays, and for some routes to simply cease existing. Because it never rains in Seattle, and it would never occur to anyone to prepare for it.
