I’ve seen an upswing in political spam lately, I’m not quite sure who the target audience is, most 419 emails are more convincing and coherent. Read on for your guarenteed surefire way to convince those pesky liberals using the “Daisy Cutter Moab Rebuttal.” (copyrighted for use by Republicans only) First an example talking point:

> Liberal Lie #1: In October 24-26, 2000, detailed drills were held in the Pentagon practicing response in case an airliner crashed into the Pentagon building.
> 
> FACT: If God inspired the planners at the Pentagon to prepare for an attack on their building nearly one year before the September 11, 2001 attacks, they should be commended, not cast into suspicion.

Is there a name for the logical fallacy “Because God made it so”? And then there is this wonderfully mind-boggling, named after a weapon of mass destruction line of “reasoning” > Dear Fellow Republican, (<cite>ed. sent to an interal [protest.net](http://protest.net) mailing list</cite>)
