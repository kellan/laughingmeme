Las Manitas was one of my favorite things about Austin. I miss it. I took a photo of the [empty lot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kellan/3353411827/) that used to be my favorite breakfast spot in the whole world.

The [Flickr nearby page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kellan/3353411827/nearby?show=thumb&fromfilter=1&by=everyone&taken=alltime&sort=distance) is one of the best memorial to it Iâ€™ve seen.
