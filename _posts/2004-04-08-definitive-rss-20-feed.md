I’ve probably alienated any RSS 2.0 fans who might have once read this site (see [train wreck](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001681.html)), but my question from January still persists, can someone, anyone, point me at a feed, or set feeds the parsing of which would demonstrate at least marginal RSS 2.0 competence?

Dave’s [feed](http://www.scripting.com/rss.xml) is missing the T and L of the core RSS <acronym title="Title, Link, Description">TLD</acronym> tripod. Sam’s [feed](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.rss2) gets a bit esoteric, while a [Moveable Type](http://moveabletype.org) RSS 2.0 feed might be considered politically suspect.

Ditto, does anbody still publish an 0.90 feed?

Anybody got an example feed I can test against? Help!?
