Last night Jasmine and I made the trek out to JFK/Umass stop. We followed the crowds, and the signs, and the voices blaring from loud speakers. There were signs everywhere, but they all seemed to have different messages. No one was listening to anyone else, there was no coherent platform, it was a mess. And the overt police presence was creepy. Everywhere you looked there was someone in uniform. Iâ€™m telling you, thats the last time I go [New England Spring Flower Show](http://www.masshort.org/).

Oh, and Peace Rally today, Boston, 5pm, Government Center.
