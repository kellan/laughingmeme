Google’s decidedly [creepy pitch to the health care industry](http://google-health-ads.blogspot.com/2007/06/does-negative-press-make-you-sicko.html) to help facilitate their ongoing astroturf/PR campaigns has been [all](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-06-30-n86.html) [over](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/30/google*to*hmos*pay*u.html) the web.(after all who better to create fake consensus then the current undisputed arbitrator of the collective wisdom)

What I haven’t seen anywhere is anybody putting this together with Google’s quiet, and [not so quiet](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/health-care-information-matters.html) [wooing of the health care industrial complex](http://services.google.com/blog*resources/Bosworth*AMIA\_May07.pdf) at large.

Google has identified the health care industry has big growth, and this is the start of the full court push.

I wish [Adam](http://www.adambosworth.net/) was still blogging. Be interesting to get his perspective on all this.
