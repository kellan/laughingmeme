Having spent the morning playing with [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/), I’m going to take the name at face value and assume it’s really a very subtle plot to kill open source productivity, and will hence forth be referring to it as [“cointelpro”](http://subversion.tigris.org/) instead.

**update:** I confess I was wrong, anything you say, now please just put away the hot irons. Having been told by all my nearest and dearest exactly how wrong I am, I confess, there were really 4 fingers, my memories to the contrary were faulty. I’ll swear off tech blogging (burying it certain fathoms beneath the earth no less), and go back to posting pictures of fluffy kittens, and unsubstaniated Oregonian rumors.
