Recently was given an axiom which turns out to be folks engineering wisdom, namely:

> *Optimizing a system requires sub-optimizing the subsystems. Conversely optimizing a subsystem sub-optimizes the global system.*

Chewing on that as it relates to technology and organizations.

Thoughts?

(In particular I was thinking about the related corollary this afternoon, namely, “We work hard to be able to be this dumb.”)
