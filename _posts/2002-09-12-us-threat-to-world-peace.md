Newsweek (of all people) has a [great interview with Nelson Mandela](http://www.msnbc.com/news/806174.asp?cp1=1). (sorry about MSNBC link) Choice quotes:

> United States chose to arm and finance the [Islamic] mujahedin in Afghanistan…most catastrophic action of the United States was to sabotage the decision that was painstakingly stitched together by the United Nations regarding the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan…United States of America is a threat to world peace…Scott Ritter, a former United Nations arms inspector who is in Baghdad, has said that there is no evidence whatsoever of weapons of mass destruction… what we know is that Israel has weapons of mass destruction… I see yesterday there was an article that said [Cheney] is the real president of the United…[Cheney] opposed the decision to release me from prison.

In related news, Bush failed to produce any evidence of Iraq’s “weapons of mass destructions”, in his [address to the Genera l Assembly](http://www.upi.com/print.cfm?StoryID=20020912-114038-2328r) today. Instead they got a list of UN resolutions that Bush claims Saddam violates. Fortunately name calling, is not proof. For example, when I say, “Bush needs to follow his script closer, or get a better speech writer”, I have not built a substantial case for waging nuclear war on the US. The speech also included the best example of Catch-22 I’ve seen in a while.
