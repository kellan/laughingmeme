I meant to write something literate this morning in honor of the occasion, but I woke up feeling dissipated and out of sorts, which I suppose is enough of a tribute in its own right. Supposed to be something of [a circus this year](http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com/), on the centenary of that “epic journey” (and not as I’ve seen folks saying the centenary of the book’s publishing, which was only 82 years ago, and not to the best of my knowledge on June 16th)

Speaking of being published 82 years ago, does anyone know what happened with the [Joyce’s estate banning public readings](http://funferal.org/mt-archive/000514.html) train wreck?
