[U.S. Government wants better Whois Records](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57776-2002May22.html)

How much will we justify in the name of protecting people from the “bad guys”? Can anyone believe in the current political climate that the govenment wants better information about domain owners simply to fight fraud? There is already a dearth of spaces and opportunities to publish freely and anonymously online, without being totally marginalized. How does all this new regulation fits with the idea that:

> Congress shall make **no law** abridging the freedrom of speech, or the press

And there are better options. Why does the government need to know where I live to regulate my ability to defraud people? There has been enough work done on trust metrics, that this problem should be trivial to solve. And the claims that the idea of a web of trust is too complicated for “the masses” is put to lie everytime someone successfully uses eBay.
