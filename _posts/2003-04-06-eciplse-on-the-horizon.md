I’ve been eyeing [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) for a while now, fascillating between the deeply scarring memories of trying to get [Resin](http://caucho.com) and JBuilder to play nice, and the luring siren call of alpha geek endorsements. [NEdit](http://www.nedit.org/) has been a steady companion for the last 2 years, a bit of Mac inspired sanity in the open source editor bedlam. With coding time spent in <acronym title="Java">IDE dependent languages</acronym> at a minimum Nedit has been all I could want. But, I think Meg’s [exhuberant](http://www.megnut.com/technology/006764.asp) [enthusiasm](http://www.megnut.com/technology/006774.asp), coupled with the shiny new [Epic, Perl Eclipse Integration](http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/) has me convinced. Now I just need a project to take it out for a test spin on.
