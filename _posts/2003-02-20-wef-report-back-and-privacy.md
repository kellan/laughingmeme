Came across an [intresting WEF report back](http://www.topica.com/lists/psychohistory/read/message.html?mid=1711891071&sort=d&start=4389) from a journalist who got one of the special golden tickets. Started out as a private email, eventually hit a mailing list, and from where the public archives, and from there…the world. Now its at the heart of its own [little controversy](http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=938). This has been an ongoing problem with IMC as well, email, prevalent archives, and Google are radically re-shaping the face of privacy, and not in a thoughtful or prescriptive way.

Interesting excerpt:

> *Al Qaeda, they say, is like a brand which has been heavily franchised.*

The parallels to anti-globalization organization like [Indymedia](http://www.indymedia.org) or [ATTAC](http://www.attac.org/indexen/index.html) are very clear. And bit alarming giving our blossoming security state. This is what [Net War](http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR880/) is about. update: read the [Bruce Sterling annotated version](http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/351-400/00362_the_mood_at_davos.html) of the famous email. \[via [moreLikeThis](http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/)\]

> *The tipping-point is gonna come when these Seattle ’99 street canaille stop waving their anarchist black flags, and start waving light-blue UN flags, because they are all commercially underwritten by billionaire BINGOs (Big International Non-Governmental Organizations).*

and > *One brick through the window of a French McDonald’s â€“ vandalism. Ten thousand bricks through ten thousand French McDonald’s â€“ more effective than napalm. McDonald’s, Monsanto, Microsoft… and hey, that’s just the M’s.*

and > *“Entire sessions were devoted to arguing which poses the greater asymmetric threat: nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.” (((Or, if you’re Argentinian, the International Monetary Fund.)))*

Good stuff.
