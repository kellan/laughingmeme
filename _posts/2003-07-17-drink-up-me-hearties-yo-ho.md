Saw [Pirates of the Caribbean](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0325980). By rights it should have been dreadful. But it wasn’t. It was excellent. Best movie I’ve seen come out of Hollywood this year. [Johnny Depp](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Depp,%20Johnny) is perfect, perfectly cast in an amazing role. The movie turns on his performance, quirks are out in force, and brilliant. And I think I’m developing a crush on [Keira Knightley](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Knightley,%20Keira).
