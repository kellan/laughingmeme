Of the half dozen books I took to Paris I was looking forward to [Ghost Brigades](http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Brigades-Sci-Essential-Books/dp/0765315025), and [The Demon and the City,](http://www.amazon.com/Demon-City-Detective-Inspector-Novels/dp/1597800457) as two promising sequels to books I had enjoyed — [Old Man’s War](http://www.amazon.com/Old-Mans-War-John-Scalzi/dp/0765315246), and the truly excellent [Snake Agent](http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Agent-Detective-Inspector-Novels/dp/159780018X). Unfortunately they were both ho-hum, with Demon and City being particularly uncompelling. That said both were more grounded and believable then the labored and kind of silly [Kite Runner](http://www.amazon.com/Kite-Runner-Khaled-Hosseini/dp/1594480001). [Godwin’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin’s\_Law) applies doubly in fiction.
