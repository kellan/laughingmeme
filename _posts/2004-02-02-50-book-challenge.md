Decided I should formally declare my participation in the [“50 Book Challenge” meme.](http://blogs.salon.com/0001092/2004/01/27.html#a553) (via [eric](http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2004_01_01_index.html#107534989089356153)) Which is not to say I plan to read more books then I did last year, as I’m sure I’ve read at least 50 books a year since I was 14, with the exception of a couple years during the craziest stretches of college, and MetaEvents.com. (I’ll probably read about half as many as I did last year, after all I was un/under-employed for most of it, including an interminable 4 months in New England during a 20 year winter). But more of a promise to myself to write something about them. And just to keep it interesting (for myself) I’ll probably skip counting re-reads (as I tend to cycle through my clutch of several dozen close favorites on a 24 month cycle, though a few get read even more frequently then that), and any tech books which are pure code.

I’ve got 3 or 4 backlogged I need to right something about (or dredge up the emails to my literary pen pals, and just use that.)

Not sure why you’ve read this far, this was a pure self indulgence, but, like declaring your new year’s resolutions, should be easier to stick to it.
