> [Twitter breaks] because “it wasn’t built right — Twitter was built kind of as a hack and they didn’t really architect it to scale and they’ve never been able to catch up.” – [Fred Wilson](http://gigaom.com/2010/07/21/fred-wilson-apple-is-evil-and-facebook-is-a-photo-sharing-site/)

This is wrong.

[Twitter](http://twitter.com) wasn’t built as a hack, it was just built. The way you or I might build something new, in a couple of weeks, with some databases, and a couple of cron jobs, and a daemon or three. If they had built it [portentous voice]TO BE TWITTER[/portentous voice] they would have failed.

[Scaling is always a catch up game](http://laughingmeme.org/2007/04/12/twitter-ruby-and-scaling/). Only way its ever worked. If you never catch up then something isn’t working, but it isn’t original sin.
