Over the last 3 days, nearly 70% of all hits I’ve gotten from MSIE 5.5 (2096 out of 3083) have been fraudlent, with the majority of them (2005) being attempts at comment spam. I’m debating whether it makes sense to just ban MSIE? Or maybe to just reject all comments from MSIE?

Just in case anyone is looking at browser statistics. (this post is in no way supposed to be an election parable)
