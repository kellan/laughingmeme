Danny and Quinn are going to be great parents. You can just tell. From the fact they’ve already nicknamed their unborn daughter [Trouble](http://www.commonhouse.net/wiki/trouble), and setup a **wiki** for web based co-parenting, to Danny’s practice diapering a plush doll that can only be described as [“Cthulhu-inspired”](http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2003/02/23#1046064120).

[Kevin](http://raimi.whygodwhy.com/ok/000028.html) sounds like exactly the sort of parent I want to be:

> *“Then I looked down and he was sucking his fingers and staring at the book and I said “How much subtext are you actually interested in at this point?”*

Raimi is about five days old at that point.
