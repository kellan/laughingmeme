One of the coolest new projects I’ve heard of, and certainly the most interesting application of P2P technology I’ve come across (amazing what happens when you reconceptualize people as something other then consumers), is the [Nomad Translation Project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/targ/) (decided lack of released files), which allows a network of translators (like [Babels](http://www.babels.org/)) to do real time translation of audio streams.

Rabble has more details about the project and its [deployment for the WSF](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000302.html)
