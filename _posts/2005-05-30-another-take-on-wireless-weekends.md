Earlier I linked to [Tonx](http://tonx.org/)’s report on [success of Victrola’s wifi free weekends](http://tonx.org/index.php/archives/coffee-wi-fi-and-the-decline-of-western-civilization/).

During my sparse visits to [UZ](http://seattle.wifimug.org/?UniversityZoka) I noticed that an unofficial “laptop table” existed, with the [Monster kids](http://www.delicious-monster.com/) as its core. It had the interesting effect of setting up a second social scene. No one who has brought their laptop to a coffee shop to work will be a quality participant in the discursive, casual cafe scene, but that doesn’t mean one can’t create another equally vibrant scene built around our shared work. (Useful in particular as most of us are working in fundamentally alienating profession anyway)
