[MagpieRSS 0.4.6](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55691&release_id=139643) is a minor release. It includes further improvments to the error handling, including the squashing some pesky stray warnins and notices, and more informative error messages (particularily for XML problems).

Also, fixed some documentation bugs, added a [troubleshooting guide](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/TROUBLESHOOTING) forinstallation and usage problems, and included a new, and even simpler, example script.

Also now [Magpie RSS has an RSS feed](http://laughingmeme.org/magpierss.rdf).
