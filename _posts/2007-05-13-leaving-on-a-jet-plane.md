T-minus 5 until jumping on BART to SFO to CGD. I’ll be around and online this week from \[XTech\](http://xtech.org) (assuming \[Edd\](http://times.usefulinc.com) has the wifi figured out). The following week I’ll be totally offline enjoying a week in/around Paris with Jasmine. Having spent so much time doing “exotic” travel I’m intrigued to see what hanging-out-in-major-Western-city-as-form-of-travel will be like.

p.s. If I haven’t gotten your Paris suggestions feel free to leave them in the comments!

See y’all in a couple of weeks.
