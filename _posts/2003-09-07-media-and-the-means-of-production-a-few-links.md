I feel like there is an interesting and informative blog entry to be written about our changing culture, and experimentations in new ways of producing media, based on: [Mass Amateurisation of Nearly Everything](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/09/weblogs_and_the_mass_amateurisation_of_nearly_everything.shtml)‘s claims that its about the computers (means of production) and access to information (via [ted](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/09/06#562)), this <acronym title="Columbia Journalism Review">CJR</acronym> [article on Indymedia](http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/5/anarchy-beckerman.asp), which touches on the conflict between independent and corporate media’s approaches (and some of the difficulties we’ve faced). Mix in another CJR article this time on the [failure of the alt. weeklies](http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/5/blog-welch.asp) (via [mediageek](http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002138.html)), ostensibly the professionalized progressive media, to live up to their promise, and attempts by [The Dominion](http://dominionpaper.ca/) and [the New Standard](http://newstandardnews.net/promo/), a new [subscription based progressive news outlet](http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story712.html), (via [anarchogeek](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000213.html)) to add more professionalism back into the mix (in different ways) and there is definitely an entry just waiting to be written.
