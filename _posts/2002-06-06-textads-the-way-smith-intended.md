$65/month for root on a “virtual” FreeBSD box, from some guy named john.

Not very inspiring. But discovered as a [textad on kuro5hin](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/9/13150/93203) I can read 70+ comments about the ad, and decide next time I’m in the market for something like this, I’ll definitely look these people up.
