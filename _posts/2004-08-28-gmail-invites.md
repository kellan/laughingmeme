I hadn’t realized anyone was still waiting for [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/) invites after the initial [bubble](www.gmailswap.com), but I’ve been told I was wrong. I’ve given away a bunch, got another handful waiting to be passed out.

It hasn’t pulled me away from pine when I need to do serious email work, but for the dozen or so high traffic, deep thread, moderate interest level mailing lists I’m on, it’s perfect.

**update**: seems I was mostly correct. Perhaps the subset of folks who read LM are more likely to have the latest web tchotchke.
