Upgraded to [Straw 0.16](http://www.nongnu.org/straw/) today, it feels much more stable then 0.15. Probably moving to an asynchronous networking model helped immensely.

I probably should have waited for the deb, but 0.15 was starting to drive me crazy. Upgrading however was simple. Straw 0.15 had already setup all the dependencies for me, except python2.2-adns. To install: `apt-get install python2.2-adns`, edit the Straw Makefile to read `PREFIX=/usr`, and type `make`

Why isnâ€™t anyone savaging Straw for referrer abuse? Not that I support the recent bile, but curious how Juri has avoided being sentenced to enternal damnation.
