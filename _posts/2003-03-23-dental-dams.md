I’ll be the first to admit, I went to a [liberal school](http://www.hampshire.edu "With a crappy administration who insist on wasting money on HORRIBLE websites"). Not only did the RAs keep free condoms stocked in our coed bathrooms at all times, they also kept dental dams right next to them. I never really thought about this much except for the various artistic endeavors once could get up to with a limitless supply of bright, green, latex squares.

In the past month I’ve spent a considerable amount of time at the dentist. Which has brought the subject of dental dams rather forcibly back to mind. What I can’t understand is how anyone who has had dental work can stay in the mood when using one of these? The last thing I need in the bedroom is the memory of whirring drill, and novocaine queasiness, and generally dentist induced anxiety. That said, I’m going to lobby my dentist to carry these [vanilla flavored](http://www.blowfish.com/catalog/supplies/barriers.html#s-gly-1021) ones.
