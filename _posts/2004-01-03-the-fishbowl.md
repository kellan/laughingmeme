Things I’ve spotted in CJ’s fish bowl:

- Xmas decorations
- A panda
- A space shuttle
- A podium

Which leads me to believe that in each West Wing episode something new is in the fish bowl. I turned to the web to for a complete list of these miniature props, ideally with screen grabs.

But the web seems to have let me down! How could such a useful site not exsit? What happened to a web that has everything? Where are the obsessive geeks and fans? I confess that I gave up rather quickly after the first few promising seeming results from Google turned out to <acronym title="The West Wing">TWW</acronym> fanfic or slash.(answering, I suppose the question of where the obsessive fans are) Maybe it is still out there?
