Unfortunately in this tone deaf world people simply took it at face value.  Still what better way to launch a new product then to get people speculating about whether or not its a hoax.  It would be hilarious if tomorrow GMail is still with us, after everyone declared it a hoax.   Too bad people aren\''t playing along by not being fooled.   We live in an age without subtlety.'

Clearly we were supposed to think GMail was an April Fool’s joke. (I mean, [read the press release](http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/gmail.html) folks!) Unfortunately in this tone deaf world people simply took it at face value. Still what better way to launch a new product then to get people speculating about whether or not its a hoax. It would be hilarious if tomorrow GMail is still with us, after everyone declared it a hoax. Too bad people aren’t playing along by not being fooled. We live in an age without subtlety.
