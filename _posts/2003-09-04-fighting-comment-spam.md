Blog spam is starting to get out of control. I hear buzz about people implementing [clever](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/09/02/blacklisting) [home roll](http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/000638.htm) solutions, but is anybody packaging this up for those of us who haven’t had time to roll our own yet?

### Tarpit

I just noticed that a story of mine on tracking rss usage was accumulating lots of spam comments. When I went back and looked at it, I noticed that I had left 1 spam comment months ago on ‘phentermine’, and that all subsequent spam comments had been on the same subject, presumably brought to me by Google. Seems like it would be simple to create tarpits, posts with a notice like “Don’t comment on this story or your IP will be banned”, and then fill it full of juicy words.

Consider that a lazy web request, for an automatic comment to Moveable Type IP ban plugin.

Anybody taking a different approach? Anything I can install? Any word on a SpamAssassin for blog comments?

Also, isn’t the conventional wisdom that centralized blacklists are bad? Think ORBS?
