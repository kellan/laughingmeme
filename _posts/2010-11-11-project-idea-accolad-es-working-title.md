There are a number of new sites (as well as a number of sites from the last few generations of start ups, some ideas keep getting re-invented) that purport to be my online identity because they aggregate and/or link to the various online externalizations. (e.g. [about.me](http://about.me/kellan))

Someone should build a site that instead of pulling in just links, or pulling in recent content (recency is so **boring**) pulled in my top rated content: [highest rated Tweets](http://favstar.fm/users/kellan), [most interesting photos](http://www.flickriver.com/photos/kellan/popular-interesting/), highest rated [Quora](http://quora.com) questions (oh wait, they donâ€™t have an API, never mind), [most linked blog posts](http://blekko.com/ws/http://laughingmeme.org/+/sitepages), etc. And all, you know, pretty, with a decent stable URL.

I think that would be a useful little service if someone wanted to build it. (p.s. [accolad.es](http://www.accolad.es/) is already registered, bummer)
