[Interesting quiz](http://roughly.beasts.org/) which allows to estimate how sure you are on a variety of general knowledge topics. Heavily slanted towards UK knowledge (who the hell is Tony Benn? and why should I know when he was born?) ([via crookedtimber](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002403.html))

Got a [45%](http://roughly.beasts.org/scripts/quiz?_eq_web_session=dd4e1ee67a44a314) (contains answers, look only after you’ve taken the test) mostly on the strength of geography/natural sciences, but if you pull out the 7 questions which I’d qualify as modern British political trivia (a category I just made up which allows me to keep UK geography and history which I did alright on), I got a 55%!

The only question I got exactly right was number of U.S. states, so I guess I’m better at estimation then memorization.
