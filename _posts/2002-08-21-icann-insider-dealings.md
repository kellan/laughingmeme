Could ICANN be a corrupt corporate body, subject to insider dealings, and moneyed interests? Perish the thought!

In further news, AaronSW has coverage on how the [IMS/ISC bid to run .org has been killed](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000519) even though they had the greatest popular support among the sort of people whom .org was invented for. (besides maintaining a little project known as Bind)

Now the question is, can we find a place for ICANN on [DavosNâ€™s map](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/cat_politics.html#000138)?
