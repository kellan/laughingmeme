By rights these should be MLPs, but whatever.

[Martin](http://traumwind.de/) spotted that Magpie is [featured in the German magazine com-online/HomeP@age](http://com-online.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=sg_com_aktuellesheft). It is even on the CD, which certainly makes the first time I know of that it has been distributed on CD.

### In the Wild

Also there have been a few new additions to [“people doing cool things with Magpie”](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/links.shtml) page over the last month. Community aggregators, public aggregators which pull together resources for a particular topic or community in a shared space, seem to be whats hot, with three new ones. Programmers keeping building the “Daily Me”, and people keep suberting it.

- [QueerFilter](http://www.queerfilter.com/) is a community aggregator for GLBT weblogs and journals that uses Magpie as the parser
- [Hot Links](http://dev.upian.com/hotlinks/) is also a community aggregator with sweet twist. It aggregates low threshold links (linkblogs), and includes snapshot thumbnails of the target pages.
- [LinkLog](http://projects.codepoetry.net/linklog/) an open source tool for building a community aggregator.
- [Rouge Valley IMC](http://rogueimc.org/) uses Magpie to parse [Protest.net](http://protest.net) RSS feeds which is particularily elating as this is what Magpie was originally written for. (and [Portland IMC](http://portland.indymedia.org/) is using [XML::RSS](http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS))
