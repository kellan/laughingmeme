    - 'Made my first batch of [\"Simple Curry Anything\"](http://www.joegrossberg.com/archives/002047.html) tonight, and it worked out very well.  Used some green beans (~0.5lb, raw, trimmed) from the farm, and a can of chick peas for the \"anything\" part.  30 minute cook time is **generous**, it really is an easy recipe.  As I was still a little hungry at the end of it, next time I might incorporate some soy; either some crumbled firm tofu, or some cooked edamame to punch up the protein content. (was also thinking it might be good over quinoa)  Looking forward to experimenting with the suggested variations. (tikka masala tempeh!)'
