When I left Boston it was a barren wasteland in the wireless coffee shop scene; cold winter winds went howling across its vast emptieness, only briefly slowing to batter themselves against Trident, the wireless book store/diner on Newbury, with only one power outlet, and high table turn over.

Which makes the June Bug Cafe, in Jamaica Plain, just down the block from Jasmine’s house a particularily sweet find, but even without the limited competition, June Bug would shine.

### The Good

In JP, right next to the indomitable Milky Way Lounge and Lanes (403 Centre St., the coolest bar ever), JuneBug is in an airy storefront, decorated in silvers and reds. One half of the run is stylish little silve tables, the other is shadowy, and intimate, with comfortable couches. Power outlets are scattered liberally around the room. The bakery items are only good, but the sandwiches are excellent! There is a strong fast, free wireless signal available from anywhere in the cafe. And most importantly of all, **they serve bubble tea!**### A Few Caveats

The coffee is decent, but the espresso drinks are only soso. And I don’t know about you, but an all Ani soundtrack got to me after about 20 minutes.(thankfully I carry headphones for just such occasions) An aside, the <acronym title="Espresso Royale Cafe">ERC</acronym> by Northeastern, an old haunt of mine (mostly for convience reasons) also has wireless these days, but through some expensive, crappy little WISP. Decidely less exciting.
