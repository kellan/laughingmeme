Well, not much on calendars really, but enough that a calendar junky like me will link to it. Some **very** interesting stuff on the &lt;table&gt; backlash going too far. Calendars are tabular data, therefore it behooves you to lay them out using tables. And a good hands-on example of making an accessible webpage.

If MTâ€™s calendar is that powerful, perhaps we should just ditch calendrome, and migrate [Protest.net](http://protest.net) to Moveable Type. ![:)](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)
