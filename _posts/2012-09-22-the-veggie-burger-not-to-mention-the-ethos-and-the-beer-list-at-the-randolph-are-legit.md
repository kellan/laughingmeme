> “Let me tell you about the kitchen, it’s small, everything has to be made fresh, that guacamole, we make it when you order the sandwich, it hasn’t been sitting around. The sauces, the sauces are all less then two days old.” … “I work here, I should know everything about this place. I should know where we buy our produce, and where the wood of that table came from.” … “It came from a single tree in upstate New York, all the wood in this bar came from that tree.” … “What type of tree is it? You see that tall skinny guy at the bar, with his mother? He’s the owner, I’m going to go ask him, I’ll be right back.” – [The Randolph](https://foursquare.com/kellan/checkin/505ce8b1e4b08887c5cd6ea1)
