I meant to post something before we left on Wednesday, but to anyone who has been trying to get in touch with me, I’ve been out of email and cell phone range for a few days, so sorry if I haven’t gotten back to you. Also sorry if you’ve been trying to leave voice mail Sprint seems to have royally fucked up their billing system and refuses to accept payment from me of any sort but have turned off my phone.

Since then we’ve arrived in Vancouver, and I’m even less likely to get back to you, as our car was broken into and [my shoulder bag](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001419.html#001419) with [my laptop](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000824.html) and phone and Jazz’s camera was stolen.

And this crummy internet cafe won’t even let me run putty in place.
