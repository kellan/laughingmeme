Stumbling onto this \[Fab.com 2011 retrospective\](http://www.slideshare.net/fabulis/fab-2011-timeline), reminded me of something that’s been puzzling me. While I knew a bunch of great folks going to work for Fab.com, including Lori Dorn and Beth Ferreira, I didn’t know any of their geeks. Which is odd in a small tech scene like New York.

Turns out the geeks are \[True Sparrow Systems\](http://www.truesparrow.com/), they appear to be a boutique Rails shop, they’re based in Pune, India, and described as \[co-founders\](http://blog.fab.com/post/3851661712/bradford-here-reporting-from-india-jason-and-i). And \[Jason Goldberg\](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=42236) did his last company, socialmedian, with them as well.

Mystery solved.
