> Converse claimed that only around ten per cent of the public has what can be called, even generously, a political belief system. He named these people “ideologues,” by which he meant not that they are fanatics but that they have a reasonable grasp of â€œwhat goes with whatâ€?â€”of how a set of opinions adds up to a coherent political philosophy. Non-ideologues may use terms like “liberal” and “conservative,” but Converse thought that they basically donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about, and that their beliefs are characterized by what he termed a lack of “constraint”: they canâ€™t see how one opinion (that taxes should be lower, for example) logically ought to rule out other opinions (such as the belief that there should be more government programs).

Isn’t a person who has an inability to understand basic concepts of cause and effect suffering from a fairly severe mental illness? Terrifying to think that describes 90% of the country
