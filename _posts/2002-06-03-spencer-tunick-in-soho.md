Everything I said in my last entry about New York feels even more true after having been here for a few days, with one exception that its true some things only happen in New York.

At 5:30am (approximately the same time [rabble](http://anarchogeek.com) was doing an interview on C-Span) Jasmine and I where packed into a warehouse behind [Art in General](http://www.artingeneral.org/), with 300 hundred, mostly young, mostly art scene, folks, naked, having our picture taken. “Sit down, lay your head on your neighbors shoulder”, Spencer Tunick called out, I sat down, but only found the small of someones back to lay my head on, my eye an inch away from someones tribal triangle tattoo. Jasmine says she ended up in a crowd of gay men, and all she could see was pierced penises everywhere. “Hold it, hold it, heads down, stop smiling, look away from the camera, take of that hat! Good, good.” and you could hear the shutter whirr.

Then we all got up again, and put on our clothes. It felt good, but surprisingly nonsexual to have all these random naked bodies push up against you as we dug around trying to find out are these my jeans? (Nope, I don’t fit into a woman’s size 4) Then we went out into the Soho streets, and repeated the process.

So there are advantages to New York as well.

Oh, and [brazilian bikini waxes](http://www.salon.com/health/feature/1999/09/03/bikini/) are really popular in New York.
