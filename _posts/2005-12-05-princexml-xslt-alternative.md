I’ve had a todo item “Check out \[PrinceXML\](http://www.princexml.com/)” since seeing it mentioned in ALA’s \[Printing a Book with CSS\](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/boom).

So I got so far as figuring out it wasn’t opensource, and seeing that the price was $349 dollars. Definitely makes me think I should probably shuffle that “Learn XSL” up the todo list again.

Still I’m very intrigued, and will probably download the trial version when I’ve got enough free time that I can pour some into learning a proprietary tool.

Anyone else played with it?
