So this year I’m finally going to make it to \[SxSW (Interactive)\](http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/). I’ve been meaning to go for *years*, but I’ve always been busy, out of the country, or going to \[ETech\](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/).

So does anyone have advice on where to say, where to go, who to meet up with? Anyone looking for a roomie?
