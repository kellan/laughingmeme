Calendaring on the web is starting to show signs of reawakening from death like sleep.

\[CalDAV\](http://ietf.webdav.org/caldav/home.html) seems to be fulfilling \[my early hopes\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001957.html) for it; creating the first real movement on calendaring standards in years. CalDAV recently had a \[successful coming out\](http://www.calconnect.org/roundtable2.html) at the \[CalCONNECT\](http://www.calconnect.org) vendor event demoing implementations from Mozilla (Sunbird), Novell (Evolution), and Oracle. Neither Microsoft nor Apple \[deigned to attend\](http://lists.osafoundation.org/pipermail/ietf-calsify/2005-February/000444.html).

\[Hula\](http://hula-project.org), the Novell backed open source groupware for the web project is generating considerable buzz with its high profile, if back handed, \[endorsement from JWZ\](http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html), good track records of \[tech leads\](http://nat.org/), and a wiki with all the right talking points.

Folks at \[U.C. Berkeley are doing good thinking\](http://groups.sims.berkeley.edu/EventCalendar/) on public event calendars as distinct from office scheduling aids as is \[evnt\](http://evnt.org), a London skunkworks exploring the \[intersection of time, space, and open info\](http://p.evnt.org/blog/2005/01/introduction).

Google is fueling \[speculation\](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004282.html) with \[rumors\](http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2005/02/23/google-calendar/) of a build vs. buy argument taking place behind the doors of Mountain View.

While \[Trumba\](http://www.trumba.com/) has an \[everything old is new again\](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002196324\_jaech04.html) feel, powerfully reminding me of golden age players in the space like \[When.com\](http://when.com) and \[Anyday\](http://anyday.com). (and events calendars for \[local radio\](http://www.trumba.com/calendars/kexp) was a major \[MetaEvents\](http://metaevents.com) plank)

Trumba and evnt both seem to have caught the wave that I credit \[Upcoming\](http://upcoming.org/) for pushing into the mainstream, namely that slavishly translating a wall calendar layout to web is \[misguided at best\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001224.html#webcalui).

\[School Bell\](http://www.schooltool.org/schoolbell), an organizational calendar initially targeting schools just relaunched now built on Zope 3, and is looking very promising. (I’ll be ready for that demo real soon \[Tom\](http://tuttlesvc.teacherhosting.com/blog/blosxom.cgi))

While the activist community in NYC has a renewed push for a community wide events portal.

All very exciting. Hopefully this time around we’ll have learned the lessons of \[integration and syndication\](http://blog.teledyn.com/node/2126), ending up with productive engines that can integrate with our increasingly busy, decentralized, adhoc lives.
