On my last two days in New England, Jasmine and I took a trip back to Amherst, MA, where we had gone to school. I’m back on the West coast again, and Seattle is more beautiful then any city has a right to be, but Amherst is the only place I found out there that could really compare. I know a few of you reading this site almost spent sometime in Amherst, so here are the photos from our [hike around Puffer’s Pond](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/amherst). (more familiar sights such as the long line at Bueno y Sano didn’t make the editorial cut)
