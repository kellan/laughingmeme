[Magpie](http://magpierss.sf.net) hits 10,000 views and 1,000 downloads at approximately the same time this morning! Its not a first birthday (a 1.0 release) but it feels like a big step for my little project.

Look for version 0.5 sometime real soon now with better namespace handling. The code is written in my head, but it needs to be typed, and debugged.

In other news Magpie is currently the 2nd result when you search Sourceforge for “rss”, and we’re only .500 activity points out of first place. (/me laughs evilly)
