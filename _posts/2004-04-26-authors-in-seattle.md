Maybe its the rainy winter weather, but Seattle is a great city for books, and consquently a great city for author events. For example, this week we have:

- One of my heroes, [Greg Palast](http://www.gregpalast.com/), is at [Town Hall](http://www.townhallseattle.org/) tonight as part of this book tour for <cite>Best Democracy Money Can Buy</cite>, and at Elliott Bay tomorrow at noon.
- Hans Blix is [in town tomorrow](http://www.world-affairs.org/calendar.cfm?eventID=321&action=eventDetails) with his new book.
- David James Duncan (whose excellent [<cite>Brothers K</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/055337849X/) is one of my favorite books) will be at Town Hall Thursday. (Jason Webley will be at town hall Friday night for his new CD release party, but that isnâ€™t really an author event).
