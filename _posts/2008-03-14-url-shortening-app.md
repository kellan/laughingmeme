Anyone got recommendations on a good open source URL shortening app (ala \[tinyurl.com\](http://tinyurl.com))to run at Flickr scale?

Its an easy enough problem thats its probably worth rolling your own, but I have to imagine there are one or two tricks.

Lazyweb, are you out there?

And yes, I know just asking this question means Iâ€™m walking perilously close to admitting that Dave \[might be right about something\](http://rc3.org/2007/11/20/urls-by-design/).
