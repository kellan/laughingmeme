Was reminded tonight that the [Feed Validator](http://feedvalidator.org) is not in the business of validating RSS 1.0, something I had [commented on before](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000290.html), but had forgotten. Remembered tonight when I noticed that the otherwise excellent RSS feeds from [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) are declaring the same resource multiple times per feed (i.e. multiple items have the same rdf:resource/rdf:about aka item\_uri).

Which should cause trouble for practically no one ([XML::RSS](http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/), and [Magpie](http://magpierss.sf.net) are both fine with it just to kick out two data points), and it is understandable to produce such a feed as many toolkits (earlier versions of [XML::RSS](http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/), and the current version of [RSSWriter](http://usefulinc.com/rss/rsswriter/) for example) donâ€™t provide a syntax for giving an item a distinct link and item\_uri. But the Feed Validator should at least mention it.
