Clearly the economy is in a bad way.

What I can’t figure out is why I’m seeing a **huge** spike in employment inquiries (most totally ridiculous head hunter crap, and some really awesome “work on stuff that matters” style projects), the Web is full of the most innovative stuff I’ve seen in years, and [ everyoneiknowisdoingawesomeshit](http://delicious.com/migurski/everyoneiknowisdoingawesomeshit).

Some days its hard to stay pessimistic.
