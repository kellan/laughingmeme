Cozens: “[Shamans have long known the value of the correct and definitive naming of things](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2225); programmers of libraries and modules would do well to rediscover it.” On **one** (of several) reasons why CPAN is **SO** much more successful then the bevy of similiar projects that have sprung up for Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, etc.

A nice sounding [wireless cafe in San Jose](http://www.digitalcity.com/sanjose/entertainment/venue.adp?vid=195653), (via oblomovka)

A nice looking [tutorial on Axis](http://www.ammai.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=4&page=1
), the next generation Apache SOAP 2.3, now-its-supposed-to-be-easy, toolkit in Java.

PHPCon2002: Why Yahoo is switching [away from their home-rolled solution, and to PHP](http://public.yahoo.com/~radwin/talks/yahoo-phpcon2002.htm). Perl gets knocked, justifiably for the “There Is More Then One Way To Do It” mentality. (see [state of Perl web development](< http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000154.html#000154>))

Jon Udell: [Bellheads vs. Netheads](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/10/28.html#a490), voice-over-ip is a cool chance to own the infastructure (aka seize the means of production) but I just don’t see us winning as long as the Bells own the backbones.

[Chandler](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000007.html) is Mitch Kapor’s new, much hyped, open vapour PIM. I feel like I have to blog it, being a calendar guy, but I can’t get excited about it. But maybe you can? Afterall, Lotus Agenda rocked, [yoz talks about why it rocked](http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/000141.html#000141), in particular its free-form data entry.
