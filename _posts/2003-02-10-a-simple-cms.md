The open source CMS hordes are legion – uncountable and unknowable – and so I turn to LazyWeb for advice. I’m looking for a simple CMS for a friend to help manage and publish websites which are largely statically published. Key features are multi-lingual content negoiation, web driven publishing, and a simple template system.

- Multi-lingual content negoiation: The system should have a concept of a resource (e.g. index.html) that can be published in multiple languages (e.g. index.html.en, index.html.es). Ideally the interface would hilight pages which lacked a translation.
- Web driven publishing: What we’ve all come to expect for a CMS, type in your password, get presented with a form.
- Simple template system: Again nothing special here, something to separate content and structure, hide HTML when desired, and make migration to a new look easier.
- Ideally the system would also be written in PHP (as that seems to be what most of the community knows) and it would be nice if the pages where [baked](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404), statically rendered at publish time.

I’ve played withe usual suspects, and explored the offerings at [Open Source CMS](http://www.opensourcecms.com/). MoveableType might almost be sufficient, but something both simpler, and more focused on publishing a website rather then a linear progression would work better. Ideas? Suggestions? Is the LW golden goose dead?
