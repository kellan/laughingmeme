Sure I complained about it raining last week, perhaps a little too loudly for those old Ballard fishermen who told me it was going to rain like this for the next 4 months. However I would like to point out, in my favor, for the record, that the there was a state of emergency declared in Washington last week due to flooding (plus gale force winds), and there is speculation that today might have set new standards for amount of rainfall in a single day in the city limits.   It isn\''t just that I grew up in paradise.  So there. (nonsensical to blog this, as no one has teased me about it electronically, perhaps this is a not so subtle plea for condolences)'
