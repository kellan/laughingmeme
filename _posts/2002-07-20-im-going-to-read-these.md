…real soon now! The first 2 artciles touch on same ideas we’re struggling with on online collaboration, and how to build a new credibility model. The last is nominally what I’m getting paid to do these days, and should probably know something about ![:)](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

- [Smart Mobs](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/rheingold/rheingold_print.html)> Smart mobs use mobile media and computer networks to organize collective actions, from swarms of techo-savvy youth in urban Asia and Scandinavia to citizen revolts on the streets of Seattle, Manila, and Caracas.
- [TOOL: The Open Opinion Layer](http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_7/masum/index.html) – hopefully something more interesting then collaborative recomendations on how to consume.
- [Non-Profits on E: How Non-Profit Organisations are Using the Internet for Communication, Fundraising, and Community Building](http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_7/boeder/index.html) – Ruckus was supposed to be about this, didn’t do a very good job of answering the questions raised.
