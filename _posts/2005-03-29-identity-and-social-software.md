    - 'First feedback on [Yahoo 360](http://360.yahoo.com/) is that it doesn\''t seem to have any way to choose or change which existing Yahoo ID you accept an invite with if you\''re already logged in.  Say for example you have some really wacky setup where more then one person uses a given computer and hasn\''t logged out.  Which is to say you can find me on Yahoo 360 under the name \''Jasmine\''.'
