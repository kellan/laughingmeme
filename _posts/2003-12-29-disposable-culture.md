    - 'I returned to work this morning to find the McDonalds on the corner is gone.  A pile of rubble, standing in the middle of its untouched parking lot and landscaping.  I had almost expected McDonalds to collapse, come apart at the seams like a plastic punch out model, and fold up into a suitcase, perhaps leaving nothing behind but a single free standing porcelain tub that wasn\''t part of the kit.  But it makes more sense this way, to see the building, in a heap, like a giant, crumpled up cement hamburger wrapper waiting to be thrown away.'

I returned to work this morning to find the McDonalds on the corner is gone. A pile of rubble, standing in the middle of its untouched parking lot and landscaping. I had almost expected McDonalds to collapse, come apart at the seams like a plastic punch out model, and fold up into a suitcase, perhaps leaving nothing behind but a single free standing porcelain tub that wasnâ€™t part of the kit. But it makes more sense this way, to see the building, in a heap, like a giant, crumpled up cement hamburger wrapper waiting to be thrown away.
