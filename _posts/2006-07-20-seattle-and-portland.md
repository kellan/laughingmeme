I’ll be in Seattle this weekend for <acronym title="Cascadia Anarchist Tech Skillshare">c@ts</acronym>, held at the lovely [Emma Goldman Finishing School](http://www.egfs.org/).

Then in Portland all next week at [OSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/).

See you there?

p.s. haven’t had a chance to look closely at the OSCON schedule yet, anyone got a list of not to be missed sessions?
