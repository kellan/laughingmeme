Content might not be surprising to a [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net) reading crowd, or anyone who has paid attention to the media monopoly. But this is well done, engaging, and human, an excellent documentary on the <span class="caps">MPAA</span>’s secret rating board. A subject that would be quirky and odd if it wasn’t so problematic.

Make sure to watch the deleted scenes on the <span class="caps">DVD</span>, I think they cut some of the best material from the movie.

You may have to be a Netflix subscriber to get this on DVD, as they seem to be the primary distributor for this film.
