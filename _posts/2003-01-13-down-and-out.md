Wind is rattling the windows, and the kettle is hissing as I slowly page my way through Cory Doctrowâ€™s [<cite>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdon</cite>](http://www.craphound.com/down/download.php). It describes a future society of ad-hocs (aka affinity groups) who operate on consensus, and run a barter system based on reputation/karma. Interesting side note, more people downloaded the book on a single day then the entire first printing.
