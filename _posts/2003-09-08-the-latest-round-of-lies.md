It was pointed out to me that Bush dropped any mention of ever finding “weapons of mass destruction” from this speech last night, they disappeared as if they had never existed (which they hadn’t), and finding was never our purpose in Iraq (which it wasn’t). Apparently we are now in Iraq because it is “the front line of terror.”

Then we got into a brief argument over lunch about whether it was **ever** credible that there were WMDs in Iraq. Just to remind folks that last two years of American military conquest was designed, and agreed upon as early as 1992, and documented in detail in Sept. 2000 as part of the “Project for a New American Century” by Project for the New American Century, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and others. This story keeps being report over and over (see the Guardian’s recent [This war on terrorism is bogus](http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/comment/0,12956,1036687,00.html)) but even the U.S. liberals who seem to hate Bush with a special passion fail to understand how badly they’ve been compromised. Not sure what its going to take.
