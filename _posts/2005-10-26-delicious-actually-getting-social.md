It is interesting to sit on a blog post for 3 weeks, and see how well they age. Most age very badly, but some age badly for excellent reasons, i.e. the world changes. (politics are a **great** example of this right now, but that isn’t what I’ll be talking about)

### Digital Lifestyle Aggregation: Using My Friends

I’ve had this persistent idea, nagging me, that somehow I should be able to use my \[Flickr\](http://flickr.com) contacts to filter the overwhelming amount of data that gets pushed at me, with the small idea being if I had a way to capture the \[del.icio.us\](http://del.icio.us) accounts of all my various contacts, then I could at least build a smarter \[del inbox\](http://del.icio.us/inbox). I had started to sketch out a tool (I was thinking \[ning\](http://ning.com)) called “theyisthey” to keep track of relationships I know between people’s various identities. (\[43people subscriptions\](http://www.43people.com/subscriptions) are one step in this direction, and certainly an indication of how social software can be used for purposes more interesting them high score lists.)

### Hear the Good News

Well we showed up en masse (\[Brian\](http://hybernaut.com/), \[Ben\](http://mantled.com/), Eric Hopp, \[Jared\](http://www.redjar.org/jared/blog/), \[Mako\](http://mako.cc/), \[Seth\](http://mojodna.net/) and I) to the \[Joshua’s Berkman lunch\](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/berkman*joshuas*news.html) yesterday, and the most explosively interesting thing I thought he said (beyond some numbers which Brian wrote down) was that “networks” are in the works. A replacement for del’s broken inbox metaphor, networks are 1-way, opaque social networks that you can build to not only filter content, but also enhance it. (e.g. when tagging a link, see the tags and notes from everyone in your network who has also tagged this link, or install the Firefox plugin to see your networks notes on webpages in the wild)

Very cool.
