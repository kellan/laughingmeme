I buy a lot of tech books (see [One Man’s Attempt to Support Tech Publishing](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001396.html#001396)), and generally have a whole slew of (largely uninformed) opinions about them.

Which is why I was kind of surprised when O’Reilly brought out the [“Head First”](http://headfirst.oreilly.com/) series, and shocked when it was pointed out to to that they are consistently some of [O’Reilly’s bestsellers](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/top25.html). I can’t help but wondering if it has something to do with their [Cosmo inspired cover design](ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/graphics/book_covers/hi-res/0596007124.jpg)?
