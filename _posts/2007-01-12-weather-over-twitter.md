And while we’re talking about recent hacks, [Blaine](http://romeda.org/blog/2006/12/weather-by-twitter.html) and I whipped up a Jabber bot using his [Jabber::Simple](http://romeda.org/blog/2006/11/announcing-jabbersimple.html) and the [Yahoo weather feeds](http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/), to provide twice daily weather updates via [Twitter](http://twitter.com).

[Jabber](http://jabber.org) is an intriguing platform to build on top of, and the more I play with it the more potential I find. I keep checking in on it every few years (since MetaEvents days), but recently its gotten much more interesting. In part thats Google’s adoption of the standard (and the subsequent enhancement in tools, libraries, and clients), and partially standards bake slowly, but at the core of it I think we’re reaching a point in the evolution of the Web where Internet-scale deployed messaging standards have a lot to offer of us. A protocol for when HTTP fails you.

> If you follow these bots, you’ll receive those updates wherever you normally get your Twitters; IM, Phone, RSS, or just on the web. So far, we have bots for the following cities: [Boston](http://twitter.com/wxboston), [Brighton](http://twitter.com/wxbrighton), [Chicago](http://twitter.com/wxchicago), [Helsinki](http://twitter.com/wxhelsinki), [London](http://twitter.com/wxlondon), [Los Angeles](http://twitter.com/wxla), [New York](http://twitter.com/wxnyc), [Paris](http://twitter.com/wxparis), [Portland](http://twitter.com/wxpdx), [San Francisco](http://twitter.com/wxsf), [Seattle](http://twitter.com/wxseattle), [Singapore](http://twitter.com/wxsingapore), and [Vancouver](http://twitter.com/wxyvr). If you’d like to see another city, just ask and we’ll provide.

Slightly out of date source available at [twitter-weather – Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/twitter-weather/)

And taking requests for new cities. Probably do a big batch of new ones sometime next week. (not really an automated process)
