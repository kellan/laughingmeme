Bujold is reading at [Booksmith on Haight tomorrow night at 7pm](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/196248/).

“Who?”, [name redacted] asked.

Bujold.

Whose Vorkosigan books are the best long form speculation on the role and future of reproductive technology disguised as military space sci-fi headed by a coded-female male solider protagonist (with incarnated other) over 9 volumes, with apologies to Austen, ever written.

And even [Larry Wall likes her](http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/109).
