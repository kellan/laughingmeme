I love [iPulse](http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp). A slightly refactored display (less pretty, more functional), and the option to monitor a remote box would make it too cool for words. And maybe add some of [WorkRave’s](http://www.workrave.org/) RSI prevention features. And why don’t more applications make intelligent use of their dock icons?

If iPulse is just sitting there, try launching [LimeWire](http://www.limewire.com/), and watch it go wild!
