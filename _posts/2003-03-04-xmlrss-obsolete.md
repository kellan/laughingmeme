I would just go to sleep, if I could drift off. But as I can’t my mind is wandering all sorts of useless places. Like my frustration with current direction of RSS 1.0 which is leaving XML support farther and farther behind as a design consideration. I’ve always supported the RDF syntax in RSS 1.0, but its frustrating not to be able to be a first class citizen with an XML parser. The idea originally was to be able to do both.

I guess I’m touchy as I’ve spent a fair amount of time recently getting decent XML based RSS parsers into peoples’ hands, and I don’t want that work to simply end up useful for nothing other then supporting the Userland ego trip.
