I was listening to the radio (NPR, didn’t catch which show) this morning tut-tut about the Bolivian uprising (see Rabble’s [breathless denouement](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000252.html#000252), and coverage at [Big Left Outside](http://bigleftoutside.com/), and [Bolivia IMC](http://bolivia.indymedia.org/)). One point they kept bringing up was Mesa’s supposed lack of political expirence ([echoed in the Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/19/international/americas/19BOLI.html?ex=1067140800&en=ab1d50b5539fc15e&ei=5062&partner=GOOGLE)), as apparently he is known for his work as a historian, and most recently a TV journalist.
