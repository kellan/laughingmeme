[Lessons from Giant-Scale Services](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/Giant.pdf), Eric Brewer, UC Berkeley &amp; Inktomi, PDF, via [wmf](http://wmf.editthispage.com)

I donâ€™t think IMC is *quite* there yet. Give it time. Almost makes me wish the job interview with Inktomi had gone better.

Just like not getting a chance to work on [Seda, another neat idea from Berkeley about high availability](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/sandstorm/), is going to make me regret not taking the [Bang](http://bangnetworks.com) job offer.

What this says to me, is I need to cut out the middle man, and go back to school at Berekely.
