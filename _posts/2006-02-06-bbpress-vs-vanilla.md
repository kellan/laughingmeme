Iâ€™m not really a web forums type guy, but the light weight interfaces of \[bbPress\](http://bbpress.org/) and \[Vanilla\](http://getvanilla.com/) do a lot to redeem the medium. Anyone got a preference from using them?

Also anyone have a mbox import script for importing old list traffic?

Part of the very slow, long running process of re-launching the Magpie site, and breaking my \[Sourceforge\](http://sourceforge.net) dependency.
