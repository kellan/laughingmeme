I hear a lot about branding and message. It comes up over dinner, and when driving down the brand festooned streets of a major metropolitan area.

I’m not entirely sure how this relates, but I feel there are important lessons to be learned by [Coach Farms][coach], maker of the triple cream goat cheese brie we bought this weekend but whom [Google knows](http://www.google.com/search?q=coach+farms&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official) as the premiere source of [“Coach Farm’s Alpine Goat Semen: Now Available”][coach].
