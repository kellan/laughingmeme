My first Powerbook lasted exactly a year (and is probably still running happily somewhere), my second Powerbook lasted 2 weeks (and was returned to the Apple store this evening), the current one will hopefully outlive its projected lifetime around 2am tomorrow morning.

**update:** Well it survived to morning, and is still looking all perky and new, but after running Software Updates I’m getting an error linking against WebKit (symptom: Safari, Software Update, Mail or Help Viewer start to load, but abort silently, full details in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter). I called Apple Care this morning (1-800-APL-CARE, a number I couldn’t find on their site, had to call the local Apple store for it), and after being transferred around a few times their only suggestion was to do a complete clean re-install (well ‘Archive and Install’). Come on people! What is this, **Windows**!?!?
