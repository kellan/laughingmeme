On recommendations we grabbed the first few episodes of [Lost](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/). No one told me it was scifi (even if it is closeted scifi). Now we’re left with all these burning questions, and a contract not to peek ahead into the future to answer them.

But we’ve got one burning question for all you farther along, do they ever explain how a [Desi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desi) scion of London came to be fighting in the Republican Guard?

Or is that just failing to properly suspend disbelief?
