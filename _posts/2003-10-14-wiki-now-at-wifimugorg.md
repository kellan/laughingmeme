Now that I think I’ve solved its various cache issue (except a lingering one, which I’m convinced is a bug in Safari), I’m please to announce…

The wireless coffee shops of Seattle wiki is now at its own domain, [wifimug.org!](http://wifimug.org)

The best part about moving the wiki to its own domain (besides the boost in credibility) is this opens up the possibility for having a whole federated network, of loosely autonomous locale based wikis of wireless coffee shops. (in other words, write me if you want a subdomain for, say boston.wifimug.org, or montevideo.wifimug.org)

### Random Wiki Thoughts

- Squid and wikis do not work well together. Its amazing how confused people can get when their changes don’t show up.
- Wiki’s generate very little Google power, especially given their inherently linky, twisty, wordy nature. I blame WikiWords, and think perhaps wikis would be better served by displaying the above as Wiki Words.
- [RSS feeds of RecentChanges](http://wifimug.org/index.cgi?action=plugin;plugin_name=RSS;edits=15) is match made in heaven.

### Next Steps

Portability. When you need a wireless coffee shop often you are standed without connectivity, a drift without the life line of TCP/IP, and a website (even a wiki!) isn’t going to help. Some ideas: - Wiki in a box – it is easy to tar up, and download a Kwiki wiki sans version history (RCS gets grouchy about changing file permissions), making it easy and obvious to keep a local copy of the wiki on your laptop might be cool.
- Auto-generate a PDF with names, addresses, and other key pieces of information (maybe on a personalized basis) for easy print out, and stuff in the pocket.
- Palm sync/iSync support
