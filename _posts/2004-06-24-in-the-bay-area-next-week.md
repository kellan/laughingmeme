I’m going to be in San Francisco next week (Mon-Fri) working out of the San Francisco office, and hanging out with [Aspiration Tech](http://www.aspirationtech.org/) and some of the smartest folks working in online advocacy. I’m hoping it will be a [“CodeCon”](http://www.codecon.org/2004/cfp.html) version of [Planetworks](http://www.planetwork.net/).

Days are mostly spoken for (and weekend I’ll be hanging out with the fam in Santa Cruz), but if anyone wants to grab coffee/dinner next week, drop a line.
