I’d seen notes that <cite>His Dark Materials</cite> film adaptation was [going off track](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002969.html), but I was quitely calm in the knowledge that Stoppard was screen writing.

It seems however that [Stoppard has been fired by the “](http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/news/story.jsp?story=585122 "Enjoyment")[Hollywood director](http://imdb.com/name/nm0919363/) brought in to make the movie.”

The movie is going to suck.

(or as Bill said back in May, [“Lyra better not be going to ‘Band Camp'”](http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/03996))
