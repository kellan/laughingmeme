I published an ever so slightly modified url to my RSS feeds, tacking on the query string `?rss` (because I’m nosy). As it is, so few people seem to follow links from within an RSS reader (something about publishing the full content as part of the feed?), that these lightly mangled URLs never even make it into my [analog](http://analog.cx) reports. And I forgot about them

Which is why I was a little startled when I grepped through my logs and noticed that [Inktomi](http://inktomi.com/) is consistently hitting the URLs from my RSS feed has been for a few weeks. Any word on what they’re up to with this?

On a side note, I think I’ve almost forgiven Inktomi for stealing the first URL I ever covetted, back in the Spring of ’96 when I was reading Lakota myths for my American Lit class, and “spider” was the hottest term on the Web.
