[Last Saturday morning’s hack](http://revcanonical.appspot.com/) seems to have fulfilled a burning need folks had, and the pace of uptake (and the occasional impassioned rebuttals) have been kind of stunning.

But even more stunning has been the outflow of awesome writing and code from some of the smartest folks around. Which I’ve been woefully failing to keep up with over at the [RevCanonical blog](http://revcanonical.wordpress.com/). The blog just hit 10 posts, which is about as many as I expected to post ever.

Thank you, you’re all awesome.
