> ( 2004-09-17 10:27:57 – Project CVS Service ) As of 2004-09-17 there is a problem with the CVS host serving anonymous CVS, nightly tarballs and ViewCVS for projects that start with the letters m, n, p, q, t, y and z. We currently do not have an estimate on when they will be back up.

Interestingly projects beginning with m, n, p, q, t, y, and z account for over half of my Sourceforge projects.

Sourceforge is in a death spiral, anyone who lived through late 90s/early 2000s should recognize the symptoms: increasingly cluttered site design, outages, new money making schemes, and an increasing divorce from reality/constituents.

**update:** oh, and changing your name is another symptom, because you know OSTG is so much better then OSDN. But they’re doing something right to get funded by [Omidyar](http://www.omidyar.net/) (major [Groundspring](http://groundspring.org) funder).
