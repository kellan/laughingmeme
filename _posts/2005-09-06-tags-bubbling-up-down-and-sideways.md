Tom Coates’s is playing with [bubbling tags up from individual songs](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2005/09/how*to*build*on*bubbleup\_folksonomies.shtml) to shows, and albums.

> a more intriguing, way of aggregating tags up through a conceptual chain would be to view albums as collections of songs and artists as a collection of albums/songs.

Are there any information theories about encouraging people to tag the smallest indivisable instead of the container? (the song vs. the show in the [Phonetags](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2005/08/reinventing*radio*on*phonetags.shtml) example) Or perhaps conversely to tag largest common demoninator? Perhaps its a lighter burden on the commons to get the handful of shows tagged, rather then each and every song? Will that always be a false normalization, one that [short circuits an important cognitive process](http://www.rashmisinha.com/archives/05*08/lazy-sheep-delicious.html) perhaps?

Because I’ve been in a couple of discussion of items inheriting tags from their containers, where the container (e.g. a playlist at [H2O](http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/), a playlist at [Odeo](http://odeo.com), or a <acronym title="Social Source Commons">SSC</acronym> toolbox) are the primary objects; meaning derived from the unique combination of different items.

And while we’re bubbling tags, do we bubble tags sideways? Phonetags enriching the rumored [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org) tagging project? And if so I wonder if the tags need to be qualified? I mean if syndicating tags is going to be anything more then a gimmick we need to know the source and the tagger, something like kellan@phonetags/electronic as distinct from kellan@del.icio.us/electronic, and kellan@musicbrainz/electronic?

No answers, just questions.
