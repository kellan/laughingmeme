Joshusa Marshall has an [update on the Republican hacking investigation](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_02_15.html#002584). I’m glad to see this isn’t just being dropped. I [still think](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001668.html#001668) that the principles should be looking at 10yrs in prison, and their bosses should be brought in on conspiracy. After all they passed these ill thought out and draconian laws which have been used to persecute a wide range of people, largely innocent.
