Have I mentioned I need to get a Mac? I really want to see how [iSync](http://www.apple.com/isync) handles the hairy beast which is synchronization. Of course [no SyncML support](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SyncML/message/1172) in this [intial release](http://www.apple.com/isync/download), as they seem to be focusing all their energy of jump starting the mordibund standard of [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com). And [Google News](http://news.google.com) lets me discover I’m not the only person caught off guard by this release, as the Seattle Times has a 10 hour old story saying [ “ISync \[is\] scheduled to ship this month but has been pushed back.”](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134544004_ptbluetooth28.html).
