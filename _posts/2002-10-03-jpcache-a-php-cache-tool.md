[jpcache](http://www.jpcache.com/) is an interesting looking tool for doing intelligent cacheing for PHP. And it seems very PHP-like (for good or for ill).

- Intelligent handling of headers, including Etags, content-encoding, and sending 304s
- paged based, ` $cachetimeout=120; include "jpcache.php" ?>`
- takes into account GET and POST data
