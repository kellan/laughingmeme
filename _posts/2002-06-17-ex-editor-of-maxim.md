For all my friends I’ve debated the merits of Maxim Magazine with, a quote by the outgoing editor:

> In fact, aside from the monthly true crime feature, we wouldnâ€™t run more than 1500 continuous words *anywhere*, as if our readers might be insulted if we asked them to, yâ€™know, read.

[Mildly interesting article](http://www.nypress.com/15/23/news&columns/feature.cfm) about coming to grips with how the modern media/entertainment industry works. Quick, [no one tell him about radio](http://www.salon.com/ent/clear_channel/), he might start crying.
