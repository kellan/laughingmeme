I’m confused, I think Tim is trying to show [bad Perl code](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/31/PerlAngst), but it looks perfectly clear to me. (and no, I’m not a “Perl god”).

Ok, well `$parents` being undefined is a little confusing, but we can assume that gets initialized off stage. (actually seeing how `$parents` gets initialized could be the most interesting part of the code, recursive walk ups, are tricky in any language)
