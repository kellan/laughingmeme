Coffee Kids has an [emergency relief fund for Sumatra](http://www.coffeekids.org/help/emergency.htm).

I’ve been meaning to blog this, but was reminded by the [notes from Jlynn’s home schooling](http://del.icio.us/rusticus), and by [Tonx](http://tonx.org/index.php/archives/victrola-redcross/).

[Coffee Kids](http://www.coffeekids.org/) is a very cool organization run, in part out of [Coffee Exchange](http://www.coffeexchange.com/revise/whoweare.html), where I spent a significant portion of the year I lived in [Providence](http://laughingmeme.org/mt-search.cgi?search=providence).
