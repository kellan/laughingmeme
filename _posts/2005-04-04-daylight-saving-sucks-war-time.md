Grumph, arggh. I hate daylight saving time. That first Monday morning is so painful, your body wakes slowly, outraged at the duplicity of clocks everywhere.

Sometimes known as “War Time” for its widespread adoption during WWI, its roots are clearly embedded in the imperial/capitalist agenda. Did you know that this morning is one of the most dangerous to drive? The spike in severe traffic accidents the first 3 days after DST is shocking. And its a key factor in why implementing a decent timezone library is such a [pain in the ass](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/6133). Not worth it.
