I was thinking about doing one of those my most popular blog posts of 2008 vs my favorite blog posts of 2008 posts (see Sippey for an \[archetype of the genre\](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/this-is-the-year-in-this-is-sippey.html)). And I noticed that the pickings were kind of sparse: 152 posts in 2008 including MLPs\[1\] and photo posts. Which got me wondering how that stacks up against past years:

```

2009: (1)
2008: ++++++ (152)
2007: ++++++++ (199)
2006: ++++++++++++++ (359)
2005: ++++++++++++++++++++++++ (602)
2004: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ (1058)
2003: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ (1268)
2002: ++++++++++ (249)
```

Maybe I’ll try to get back to and find those populate and best posts, but right now I’m trying to decide how I feel about the those posting trends.

1. What’s an MLPs: when I had my link blogging separated out as a separate stream, that blog was called MLPs, short for “Mindless Link Propagation”, the \[kuro5hin\](http://www.kuro5hin.org/) \[category\](http://www.kuro5hin.org/section/mlp) for link blogging.
