While not [phpMyAdmin’s](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) 2 million, this week [MagpieRSS](http://magpierss.sf.net) had its 2000th download, which feels moderately successful for my obscure little project. More telling for me has been the steady stream of enthusiastic feedback I’ve gotten over the last 8 months. And most rewarding of all, has been seeing people build on my humble foundations, a phenomena which has been picking up steam recently.

### Some Recent Hilights

Magpie got its first “celebrity endorsement” recently as the parser of choice for [Scott’s](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/) innovative RSS search engine [Feedster](http://feedster.com). [Laze](http://www.laze.net/fait/) hooked up [gnews2rss](http://www.voidstar.com/gnews2rss.php) with Magpie to create an automatic [custom clipping service](http://www.hgps.net/feed/); an idea that [Tim](http://geodog.thebishop.net/) is extending over at the phenomenal and timely [SARS Watch](http://www.sarswatch.org), while [MyAntiWar.org](http://www.myantiwar.org/) uses a hand selected pool of feeds to aggregate headlines on war and peace, publishing them as an attractive website, and cumulative RSS feed for re-syndication.  
Magpie has been [integrated with Midgard](http://cvs.midgard-project.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/contrib/MidCOM/components/net.nemein.rss.xml) for the [OSCOM site](http://oscom.org/), and rumor has it with PostNuke as well. Early adopter, [Infinite Penguin’s](http://www.infinitepenguins.net) [RSS Viewer](http://www.infinitepenguins.net/rss/) has a new version out and continues to be the simplest way to integrate RSS with your web page, fast and attractively. Most recent adopter is probably [Steve’s](http://minutillo.com/steve/weblog/) [Feed on Feeds](http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/) server-side aggregator. If I had any decency I’d let the man get a 0.1 version out the door before chattering about it, but I’ve installed the 0.0 version (took 2 minutes including download time), and am already happily using it.
