Michael Whelan’s [Glass Onion](http://www.michaelwhelan.com/) is a classic stop when picking up desktop images.(I reccomend his “Fine Art” gallery, over his book covers) And I’ve always liked a [Diterlizzi image](http://www.diterlizzi.com/) in my perphihal vision, especially [Alien and Possum](http://www.diterlizzi.com/tonys_work/books/alien_possum/ap-03.shtml). New to me, via [Stacey](http://contraversion.com/), is [David Lanham](http://www.dlanham.com/), esp. this [“huge freaky Miyazaki-reminescent cat”](http://www.dlanham.com/downloads/tea43.htm), very nice. And of course, lucicuous Washington [landscapes](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/olympic_trip), and [flooded cityscapes.](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/seattle_canoe)
