The last week of February is perhaps a bit late to be thinking about acquiring a calendar, but I’d like to recommend to your attention the [Artsy 2005 calendar](http://www.cafepress.com/artsy2005.15963863?zoom=yes#zoom). I’ve been meaning to blog it for weeks, and now I am.

Initially I had planned to mention [Mika Machida’s](http://www.artsymag.com/mika1.html) stark, questioning work that looked down upon January. Then it was February and [Cindy Tomczyk’s](http://www.cindytomczyk.com/) illustration which reminded me of the work of [Diterlizzi](http://www.diterlizzi.com/). Now peeking ahead [Mariestella Colon Astacio’s](http://mariestella.com/) luminescent dreamscape holds promise for March.

An excellent survey of emerging women artists, some with critical or [commercial acclaim](http://www.adweek.com/aw/creative/best*spots*04/041018\_01.jsp), others unknown, but all distinct and very talented.

[Artsy](http://artsymag.com) will get a buck or so from each sale, but more importantly it’s an excellent chance to be exposed to some amazing new art.
