The [Seattle Post-Intelligencer](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com) is running [a story on wireless coffee shops in Seattle](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/lifestyle/180190_freewifi.asp). Wifimug features prominently which is fun, even if they didn’t use any of my best lines. (which is what one always says, right?)

Interestingly since it ran, [WifiMug](http://seattle.wifimug.org) has been overwhelmed with people whom didn’t understand the wiki, and kept deleting the home page, (only 1 case of intentional defacement, and that was after the front page was already a wreck), plus several of the mentioned companies adding inappropriately commercial pitches.

I finally locked the front page, and need to think a bit more closely about how to solicit contributions (which until now have flowed in smoothly)

Still its always fun to see yourself in print, and this was no exception. Thanks to [Jon](http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/archives/001584.html), and [Jeff](http://www.idealog.us/2004/07/seattle_pi_feat.html) who spotted it first.

**update:** Wow, no one told me it was on the front page! Also I’ve unlocked the front page of wifimug, lets see if it survives this time.
