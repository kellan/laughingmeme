Heading up to Sebastopol in a few hours with the Odeo contingent, be back Sunday evening, in time to do some prep for \[Extreme Usability\](http://www.flossusability.org/) on Monday.

Interestingly I first met the wonderful/crazy folks behind \[Extreme Usability\](http://www.flossusability.org/) (and many of my close friends and colleagues), at \[Ruckus’\](http://ruckus.org/index.php) TechToolbox, a (radical) geek camp out, hosted in Sebastapol, a little over 3 years ago, less then 20 miles from the \[O’Reilly’s\](http://ora.com) campus.

Clearly the spiritual progenitor of FooCamp ![:)](http://lm.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

*update:* Some notes to come soon, but first \[FLOSS\](http://www.flossusability.org/). In the mean time, check out the \[Foocamp aggregator\](http://www.superblog.org/planet/foocamp2005/)
