“Open databases” is a concept I was kicking around with \[Carl\](http://blogs.onenw.org/carl/) in 2004. The idea was to come up with a set of common practices, and techniques to allow groups of people in low trust relationships to collaboratively build large, public datasets.

\[GMT’s\](http://greenmediatoolshed.org/) media contact database was an example, as was the work \[Locative\](http://locative.us) was doing on trying to build open map databases. We even had a cool 2-day sprint/retreat out on \[Bainbridge\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge\_Island) to get it rolling.

But I never actually used the domain name, opendb.info

It expires in 15 days (Jan 3rd). Let me know before that if you have an interesting use for it.
