Congrats to \[Andy\](http://waxy.org), \[Gordon\](http://getluky.net), and \[Leonard\](http://randomfoo.net/), and about damn time. I first saw Upcoming almost exactly \[two years ago\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001221.html) and thought “Wow, now that is how to do calendaring.” (and apparently I was jealous even back then!) Good luck!

Now we can all speculate on what \[calendar.google.com\](http://calendar.google.com) will be, but I’m thinking this round might be going to Yahoo.

**update:** And dear god, where I can get some of whatever \[Gordon\](http://getluky.net/) is on, \[Upcoming\](http://getluky.net/2005/10/05/yahoo-acquires-upcomingorg/) and \[Ning\](http://getluky.net/2005/10/04/ning-and-my-work-for-24hl/)!?!? No kidding “bred for skill in magic.”
