Its been said before, but “Someone get [that man](http://www.diveintomark.org) a book contract!”

The [30 days to a more accessible web](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/14.html#day_5_belated_introduction)is some of the best new stuff on the web. I’m totally inspired by it, particularily in my technology activism work.

Today’s entry might be my favorite example of pedagogical style:

> - [Dean Allen](http://www.textism.com/) has a graphic in his page banner that includes the name of the site and a tagline. His `alt` text is on the long side and includes a different tagline (a bit confusing), but Dean is cool enough to get away with it. `alt="Textism is an ephemeris focused on the composition, design, and reading of text.  In addition, there will be pie"`. Note: you are probably not cool enough to get away with this. Keep it simple.

Pie or no pie, I must confess though, I do miss the old diveintomark content. At least [aaronland](http://http://www.aaronland.info/weblog) is back from vacation.
