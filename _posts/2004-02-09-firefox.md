Trying not to be utterly repulsed by the Cold War era [military rah-rah](http://upx.primenova.com/mpp_main/Firefox.jpg) nature of Firebird’s new name, [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/). (also trying not to be frustrated that the work prosleyzing Firebird will have to go back, and be redone under a new name)

However the [new logo is very nice](http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2004/february/brandingmozilla) (though take a look at that Camino icon, that is goregeous!), and its still a great browser.

Hmmm, I’m starting to wonder if the Cold War references are intentional. These “Take Back the Web” banners are sprouting up.
