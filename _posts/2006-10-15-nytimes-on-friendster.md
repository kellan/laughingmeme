Reading the \[NYTimes Friendster post mortem\](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html?\_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all) , its 4 pages long, but the following paragraph jumped out at me as the most important.

> Many people working at Friendster sneered at MySpace. The holy grail at Friendster — and the cause of most of its technical problems — was its closed system: users at Friendster could view only the profiles of those on a relatively short chain of acquaintances.

In less public spaces then the NYTimes business pages you hear a lot of gossip about Frienster, mostly the personality clashes and rock star egos, but I think it really was that simple.

Failure to do the simplest possible thing that will work, and a failure to be public by default. (though going to war with your users is never a winner) It hurts an engineer’s soul, but worse really is better. (thank goodness I’m not an engineer, just a failed lit major)
