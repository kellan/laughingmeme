I have to say waking up to a Pine inbox full of helpful automated notes suggesting I fix my Outlook install is fucking annoying. This [SoBig](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2003/08/20/garbage_in_garbage_in_ii.html) Windows virus going around is gleefully sticking any address it finds in the infected computers addressbook or cached html files into not only the To: field but also the From: field. I have this dream of class action lawsuit with Microsoft and Monsanto as a dual defendants accussed of being piss poor engineer who have managed to perpetuate a monoculture of unsafe, untested, poorly designed products upon the world.

**update** (via [ted](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/08/20#500))

- Slammer [ crashed nuclear power plant monitoring system](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/32425.html)
- SoBig [brought down train signalling systems](http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=13100807) up and down Eastern seaboard.

Also [Micah](http://riseup.net/~micah/nerf) talks about the [SoBig filtering rules](http://lists.indymedia.org/pipermail/imc-sysadmin/2003-August/002369.html) he added to [lists.indymedia.org](http://lists.indymedia.org) to keep it from melting down from the 100s of messages a minute we were recieving.

**update 2** and then got a message bounced from [riseup](http://riseup.net) when trying to find out about tomorrow nights screen of “Strong Roots”, a movie about MST. Had to ask about the m0vie. (7:30pm BBQ, 9pm screening at Interlaken Blvd and 24th Ave. E.,)
