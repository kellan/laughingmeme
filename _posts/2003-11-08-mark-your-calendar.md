The [UW Bookstore](http://www.bookstore.washington.edu) has an awesome [author series](http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/ubs/main.taf?area=events&page=events&catagory=events&tn=1) (I still have to write up the night Bujold was in town!), but this next week special.

The fun starts tomorrow [Nov 8th, Sat. 4pm](http://scottstuff.net/books/includes/event.php?event=University+Books%3A+David+Rees+%28My+New+Fighting+Technique+Is+Unstoppable%29&cal=all_calendars_combined971&start=4:00%20PM&end=4:59%20PM&description=+Saturday%5C%2C+November+8%5C%2C+4pm%3Cbr%3E+David+Rees%3Cbr%3E+My+Fighting+Technique+Is+Unstoppable%3Cbr%3E+Book+Signing%3Cbr%3E+University+Book+Store%3Cbr%3EThe+deadpan+comedy+style+of+David+Rees+was+born+in+the+cubicle-induced+boredom+of+an+unsatisfying+office+job.+So%5C%2C+is+the+temp+job+the+new+petri+dish+of+American+humor%3F+Or+is+David+Rees+just+a+really+funny+guy+who+had+too+much+time+on+his+hands%3F+From+the+man+who+brought+us+Get+Your+War+On+comes+a+new+book+of+old+strips.+%3Cbr%3E+http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookstore.washington.edu%2Fubs%2Fmain.taf%3Farea%3Devents%26page%3Devents%26catagory%3Devents%26tn%3D1%3Cbr%3E+ISBN%3A+1573223735&status=&location=University%20Book%20Store&organizer=a:0:{}&attendee=a:0:{}1), see [David Rees](http://mnftiu.cc). Some days [Get Your War On](http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war27.html) is the thin thread that reminds me its *them* not me who is losing it.

Then [Ivan Doig](http://www.ivandoig.com/) is in town [Nov 12, Wed. 7pm](http://scottstuff.net/books/includes/event.php?event=University+Books%3A+Ivan+Doig+%28Prairie+Nocturne+%3A+A+Novel%29&cal=all_calendars_combined971&start=7:00%20PM&end=7:59%20PM&description=+Wednesday%5C%2C+November+12%5C%2C+7pm%3Cbr%3E+Ivan+Doig%3Cbr%3E+Prairie+Nocturne%3Cbr%3E+Reading+%26+Book+Signing%3Cbr%3E+UW+Kane+Hall+220%3Cbr%3EOne+of+the+pre-eminent+authors+of+the+American+West+is+back+with+a+brand-spanking+new+novel%5C%2C+and+we+couldn%27t+be+more+excited+about+it.+What%27s+to+say%3F+It%27s+Ivan+Doig%5C%2C+people.+Get+all+his+books+off+your+shelves%5C%2C+bring+them+down+to+Kane+Hall%5C%2C+and+bask+in+the+Doig-ness+of+it+all.+And+we+want+to+see+you+do+the+wave+for+him.+Practice+with+your+friends.%3Cbr%3E+Ticket+Required+-+tickets+available+beginning+October+15+at+all+our+locations%5C%2C+while+supplies+last.+%3Cbr%3E+http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookstore.washington.edu%2Fubs%2Fmain.taf%3Farea%3Devents%26page%3Devents%26catagory%3Devents%26tn%3D1%3Cbr%3E+ISBN%3A+0743201353&status=&location=UW%20Kane%20Hall%20220&organizer=a:0:{}&attendee=a:0:{}), <cite>Prairie Nocture</cite> is getting panned, but for those of us who have done our time wandering in the purple sage of the literary West, well Doig is an important part of the landscape.
