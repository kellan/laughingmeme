I’ve seen a new type of spam over the last 2 days, or at least one new to me. A quick search through my procmail logs says I’ve recieved over 100 of these messages either personally, or via mailing lists in the last 24 hours. Anyone else seeing this? Any idea why the sudden spike?

The distinguishing characteristic is in the subject line, which are of the form:

```

$relevant_word, $spam subject
e.g.  twikiadmin,! This Auto Transport Company Might Interst You
```

Where the email address recieving the spam and the word twikiadmin appear on the same webpage. On a related note I’ve also started getting much more targetted spam for keywords on which I have a high google rank, like [canon s230](http://www.google.com/search?q=canon+s230).
