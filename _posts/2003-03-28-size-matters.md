Some discussion of [subscription sizes](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/03/netnewswire_strawpoll.shtml) over at plasticbag. While I only subscibe to 72 as opposed to [Ben’s](http://www.benhammersley.com/) 212, I do personally maintain 8 of those feeds, or 1 in 9 (and one hasn’t been updated since 1999). Thats got to count (in a bad way I’m sure) for something.
