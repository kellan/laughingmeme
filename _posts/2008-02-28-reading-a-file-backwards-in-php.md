This morning I needed to read from a file line by line from the bottom. In PHP. Perl, of course, \[has a module to do this\](http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-ReadBackwards/ReadBackwards.pm). A quick view source decided that I didnâ€™t want to get into file seeks before breakfast. Very happy with my solution:

```
$file = popen("tac $filename",'r');

while ($line = fgets($file)) {
  echo $line;
}

```
