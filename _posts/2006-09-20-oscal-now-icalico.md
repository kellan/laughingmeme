Bit slow following up on this one, but thanks all for your comments/emails/whatnots suggesting \[better names for OSCal\](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2006/09/06/help-please-oscal-needs-a-name).

Not sure it counts as better, but we went with iCalico. (which means I **really** need to get the ical working properly)

And all props to \[Evan\](http://anarchogeek.com) for getting \[an instance up for EuroOSCON\](http://eurooscon06.icalico.org/). (as is Railsâ€™ wont, more complicated to deploy then it was to write, really)
