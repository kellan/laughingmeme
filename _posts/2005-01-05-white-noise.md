Am I only one who just figured out that [<cite>White Noise</cite>](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375210/) is **not** the same as the [Sonnenfeld adaptation of DeLillo’s novel of the same name](http://laughingmeme.org/mlp/archives/2004_07.html#002238). I was considering nominating it for “worst adapation for screen ever” based entirely on the preview.
