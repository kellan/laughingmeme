We’ve been talking about a move to New York ever since I moved back from Seattle, just over a year ago. (Boston, as much as we like it, has always been a way station)

Recent events have moved up our timeline (which had been lazily extending itself for months) and now we’re looking to make a move by the end of the year. (as in 18 days and counting)

### Housing

So we’re looking for housing, either short term, or not, immediately, if not sooner. Any tips would be great. (ideally something more then “Brooklyn, baby, Brooklyn”)

### Work

And I’m taking this change to seriously start looking for the next gig, which has been on the back burner. If you read this blog you have a sense of what I do, and what I’m interested in.

If you happen to know a team doing cool and innovative work, that could use a LAMP(R) hacker, syndication guru, and/or calendar wonk, put them in touch. Additionally if you know someone interested in getting some perspective on the evolving nature of the Web, the network, or open source from someone who has been engaged in the work and community for 8+ years, I’ve been know to wear that hat as well.
