[Real Change](http://realchangenews.org/) has a slightly surreal [article about the Wal-Mart’s policy of offering free overnight camping for RVs](http://realchangenews.org/issue/current/features/coverstory.html "Wal-Mart bargin camping") in their parking lots. The people actually living in the parking lots actually make more sense to me then the people who choose to cruise from Wal-Mart to Wal-Mart. That sounds like purgatory on Earth, and frankly I’d prefer Hell.

Normally I’d make some comment about the deeply strange and troubling aspects of modern American culture, except most of the people interviewed are actually Canadian.

Also a [nicely fluffy article on Howard Zinn](http://realchangenews.org/issue/current/reviews/bookreview2.html), and the biographical documentary <cite>Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train</cite> (named after his autobiogrpahy), which is playing Seattle’s [Northwest Film Forum](http://www.nwfilmforum.org/index.shtml) Sept 3rd thru Sept 16th.
