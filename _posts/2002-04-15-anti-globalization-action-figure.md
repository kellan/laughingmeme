Its **“Anti-Globalization Medic”** action figure! Coming soon to shelves near you. (Vingear soaked banadannas, gauze, and squeeze bottle sold separately.)

Short, fat, cuddly, and obviously a hell raiser, I couldn’t resist this doll. It was supposed to be my reward for finishing my freelance gig, but, ummmm, delayed gratification is difficult. I got mine in a store in Oakland China Town, but [KidRobot](http://www.kidrobot.com) says, its “Three Zero: Agent Rat edition, a Hong Kong soft vinyl urban-style action figure”, and one of only 250.

But thats, just the cover story. Its **obviously** an anti-globalization protestor. I’m considering sending it to Washington DC, for the A20 events, as I won’t be able to make it myself. I wonder if there is an action figure affinity group?

There are 4 Three Zeros, but I’m still waiting on the a [Black Bloc](http://www.infoshop.org/blackbloc.html) one; a pure black outfit, and a tatoo that says, “Its a tactic dummy”.
