[Student Java Projects](http://mindprod.com/projects.html) is a collection of programming ideas for student getting started. I never had much trouble coming up with projects I wanted to hack on but the few times I’ve tried to teach people this has been a major stumbling block. If you aren’t coding on something you can get excited about then you’ll never push yourself to add that one cool feature just out of reach of your current abilities. Very little is Java specific.

### Philip Pullman &amp; Brin Too

When people tell me they love Harry Potter, I suggest Philip Pullman. Afterall Pullman, like Rowling is a British author writing childrens books that have broad appeal. What I fail to mention is I secretly hope that reading Pullman’s Dark Matter series will ruin people for more bland fare. The Guardian’s [overview of Philip Pullman](http://books.guardian.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-184,00.html). Plus [David Brin on Tolkien](http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/index.html). [[via morelikethis](http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/03230)] ### cc
