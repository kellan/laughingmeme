A lot of people talking about how we’ve lost the moral high ground, first Fallujah, which was the scene of spontaneous Iraqi unity in the face of oppression, and now the tortues at Abu Gharib, and now its no longer possible to win this war in Iraq. Some people feel shocked and betrayed by the leaders they followed into this war.

It as if no one could ever have imagined an outcome like this. As if for example, 100,000 people didn’t show up in New York a year ago February to express concern about exactly this sort of thing happening. Everyone who supported the war is responsible for its consqences, if you supported the war in Iraq you are responsible for Abu Gharib, there were alternatives, and the information was out there. Now what are you going to do to fix things?
