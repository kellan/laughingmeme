## tl;dr [photosnearme](http://laughingmeme.org/code/photosnearme)

I recently was added to a [“People like John Resig” Twitter list](http://twitter.com/#!/MetaThis/people-like-jeresig). I am nothing like [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/). In particular I suck at Javascript.

However, given the annoyance of properly constructing a Flickr geo feed URL (admittedly linked to from the bottom of every [places page](http://flickr.com/places/), but whose counting), I decided to make a script for it while waiting for the kettle this morning.

I broke out the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (thanks John!) and some code from [Weather Near Me](http://weathernear.me), and now there is [photosnearme](http://laughingmeme.org/code/photosnearme) for finding the feed of photos for the neighborhood you’re in. YMMV.

ps. I keep forgetting and having to remind myself, Chrome’s ridiculous over aggressive caching makes it totally unsuitable for development purposes. That was probably the hardest part of the script.

pps. I don’t care that RSS is dead, I still like it.
