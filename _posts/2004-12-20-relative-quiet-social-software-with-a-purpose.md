Sorry for the relative quiet, I’ve been doing all my blog style writing on [43 Things](http://hugster.43things.com/home/) lately. Its interesting, I’m looking forward to see it grow. We’re making a little progress using it to organize bringing [“Building Basecamp”](http://www.37signals.com/workshop-basecamp.php) to Boston.

### books we like

Rabble has an [interesting piece](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000469.html) on [books we like](http://bookswelike.net/), the [latest “folksonomy style web app”](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000469.html), where he implicitly connects it with 43 Things (“needs a ‘not worth it’ type option”), and teases out most of my immediate critiques (in order): Amazon, Don Hazen, Working Assets style we-give-X%-to-charity business model.
