I submitted this as a request to [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/), but I’m also going to through it out ot the web at large.

It would be great if someone would write a service that allowed you to subscribe to a machine translated (aka [Babelfish’ed](http://babelfish.altavista.com/)) version of an RSS feed. You give the original language, and the desired output language, and moderately mangled, but largely intelligible (if unintentionally obscured) items arrive in your aggregator.
