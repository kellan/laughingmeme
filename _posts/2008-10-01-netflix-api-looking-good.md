\[Netflix\](http://netflix.com) was pretty much the last place I was \[Web 2.0 style share cropping\](http://www.slideshare.net/IgniteBoston/12-jesse-vincent), creating value without a way to get it out. The \[Netflix API\](http://developer.netflix.com/docs/Home) has been rumored for a long time, but with today’s release they really did an excellent job.

- REST, Atom, and Javascript APIs? CHECK
- \[Access to personal information using OAuth?\](http://developer.netflix.com/docs/Security#0\_18325) CHECK
- \[Developer blog\](http://developer.netflix.com/blog)? CHECK
- \[API Explorer\](http://developer.netflix.com/page/Resources)? CHECK (though why it’s a Firefox plugin, I can only guess)

Also versioned documentation, and a quite reasonable set of \[branding guidelines\](http://developer.netflix.com/docs/Branding).
