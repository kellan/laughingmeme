 A report back on discussed REST best practices. Which he says really are a study in *the aesthetics of URI design.*

### More REST

- [Rest Roundup](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/05/08/deviant.html)
- [Rest and the Real World](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/02/20/rest.html)
- [RESTwiki](http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi)

Personally, I’m sold on REST, but then there isn’t much to sell – if you love the web, and can embrace TBL’s [Cool URIs Don’t Change](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html), your 95% of the way there. ### A Caveat

When you divorce URIs from their physical implementation you must: comunicate, document, tack proclamations to the door, to let people know what you’ve done. Especially in large, geographically diverse, volunteer organizations, like [Indymedia](http://www.indymedia.org).  Using the Apache trickery `ForceType application/x-httpd-php` I cleaned up our archive system. But to this day, I get confused emails from people trying to correlate urls to directories.
