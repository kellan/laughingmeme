One of the undiscussed (or at least I haven’t seen it discussed) benefits of test driven development is “blame management.”

<cite>“My changes didn’t cause any tests to fail”</cite> somehow slips past the filters that would reject, <cite>“Not my fault, not fixing it”</cite> as unprofessional, and so a certain Darwinian pressure is exerted to provide the best test suite for your most fragile code in the hopes of fending off sweeping, and devastating changes from other developers.
