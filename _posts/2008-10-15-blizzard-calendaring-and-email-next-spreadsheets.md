Been a while since we’ve had any \[calendaring/scheduling\](http://laughingmeme.org/tag/calendaring/) news here on \[LM\](http://laughingmeme.org). So I’m fulfilling my calendaring dork credentials by pointing out that with a certain glee, that Blizzard just rolled out a \[calendaring engine\](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/calendar.xml) to 15 million people yesterday.

Pictured here with their proprietary mail system, Blizzard is well on its way to building a full PIM/productivity suite for an alternate universe.
