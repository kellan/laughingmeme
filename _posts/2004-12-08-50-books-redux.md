Ego surfing is bad enough, but is there anything quite as narcissistic as surfing your own website? Surfing the related items from that [last post](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002624.html), took me over to check in on [little Eric/Odin](http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/) who is getting ready from his first Xmas, and then back to my post about [“50 Book Challenge”](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001714.html) ([one source](http://blogs.salon.com/0001092/2004/01/27.html#a553)). I hadn’t thought about it in a while, but I’m fairly sure I made my 50 books (though I might have to include the odd tech book). Did anyone else stick with it? Would be fun to see a slew of post mortems/book lists in the next few weeks.
