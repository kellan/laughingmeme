2002 was a good year for innovation, and \[All Consuming\](http://allconsuming.net/) was one of my favorite site that came out that year. I used it, I recommended it, I wrote scripts based on it. But slowly it drifted into unusability, got slower, didn’t evolve, and eventually I went back to using Amazon as my site for \[proxying books onto the web\](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000267.html).

3 years later its been revived (in 24 hours!), and is \[now being officially hosted\](http://robotcoop.com/weblog/72/all-consuming-has-become-a-part-of-the-robot-co-op-family) as a \[Robot Coop\](http://robotcoop.com/) app! This is great. Because there is sooo much more I’d like to see done with it! (Haven’t decided if this is good enough reason to stop hacking on my \[Rails\](http://rubyonrails.com) book management app which is still just some quick sketches in a notebook)

That said, I’m a little ambivalent of the last of focus in the new app. Not sure if its snobbery, or segregationist tendencies, but I don’t want to **share** the website with non-book like media. But thats a minor quibble.

The Robots have always said that \[43 Things\](http://43things.com) was just the first of a long list of good ideas they wanted to roll out, and here we have their second app. Congrats guys.
