I’m going to go against the apparent conventional wisdom, and note I **hated** \[Serenity\](http://imdb.com/title/tt0379786), am utterly disappointed, and hope that if they ever revive the show they’ll ignore all events of the film.

The show for all its comedy, and western aspects functions as noir. The characters are very minor, very small characters in a very large, very mean universe. They’re buffeted by the forces beyond both their control and understanding.

In the movie, they’re heroes, and not just the everyday heroes of the show, but larger then life super heroes? Rescuing the universe from evil gubermint plots? And it all fitting together all right and tight, everything neatly explained from River to reavers.

Blah.

The actors did their usual great job, unfortunately this brainless action flick gave them nothing to work with.
