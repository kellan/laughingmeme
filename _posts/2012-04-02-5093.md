> This February, Amazon again asserted its influence when it pulled nearly 5,000 titles by distributor Independent Publishers Group from its Kindle e-book store. Amazon wanted better terms, and IPG said “no.” [Amazon.com trying to wring deep discounts from publishers](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2017889877\_amazonpublisher02.html)

A thought, as Amazon’s and the publisers’ relationship gets more bruising seems like there is room to be the company listing all the books in print, and where they’re available for purchase. Could be classically disruptive business (in that it will always be tiny, but with the chance to implode something larger).

Aggregating information from a diverse set of sources all over the world is the sort of thing which even 10 years ago was hard, and is now straightforward as long as you have the right motivational loops in place.
