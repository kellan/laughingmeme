Started using [Straw](http://www.nongnu.org/straw) yesterday. I’m very happy with it. Works great. Especially once I figured out how to get links to open in Mozilla instead of Galeon. And is much more scalable in an era of RSS everywhere. (see [cvs2rss](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000296.html#000296)) The only change I really want is the ability to categorize feeds, and only see certain groups, because I already have a lot of feeds I track.

In lieu of this switch, I’m retiring the Tracking sidebar, if you use it, I can keep it available somewhere if you like, let me know. I’m replacing it with an MLP log like [Anil’s](http://dashes.com/anil) instead. A form I’ve been finding very liberating today.

Do need to figure out how to work in the blogroll aspects.
