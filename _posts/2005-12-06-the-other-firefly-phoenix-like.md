> Firefly (decision-support application)

Um, you mean like [Pattie Maes’](http://web.media.mit.edu/~pattie/) [Firefly](http://wired-vig.wired.com/wired/archive/5.12/maes.html?topic=&amp;topic\_set=), that hottest, sexiest, most buzzworthy, proto-dotcom spin off of the [Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu/)? (complete with rockstar founder). The one that was [bought, and killed by Microsoft](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,21243,00.html)?

Of course, now in our wiser, more cynical age, who would be dumb enough to pour their metadata into a closed system? To trust a company to safeguard the gates of their community?

Just kidding.
