I’m not much of a TV person (which is to say I haven’t owned a TV in 10 years or so), and I’m not much of a [Joss Whedon](http://whedonesque.com/) fan (which to say despite the persistent recommendations of people I trust and I admire, and repeated viewings I just couldn’t get into [Buffy](http://www.buffyguide.com/)), and I’m not much fond of Westerns (which is to say that I took an American West class in college with a required attendance Wednesday Nights Westerns screening, so while I can appreciate the subtleties of the genre frankly I preferred Calc homework), and yet I just started watching [Firefly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/ "Too Pretty Too Die"), and it is good, very good. Recommended. (and I’ve got the damn theme song stuck in my head)
