[Manchurian Candidate (2004)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0368008/) is sort of like a re-make of [The Corporation](http://www.thecorporation.com/) as an action thriller, with Denzel Washington playing a Hollywood-ized version of Michael Moore circa [Roger and Me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098213/). (to mix my metaphors)

Not as strong as the original, but I enjoyed it (except for a view scenes of gratuitous violence, and the very last scene of the “good guys winning” which creeped me out). The [Halliburton](http://www.halliburton.com/) digs, and looking around to see who gets it, and who doesn’t is practical worth the price of admission.
