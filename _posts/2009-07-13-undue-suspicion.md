Spent the morning bike ride composing a scifi story about a future world where \[Google’s statistics driven decision making\](http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html) has come to dominate the planet, and chip manufacturers introduce hyper subtle ideological math bugs (ala the \[Pentium FDIV bug\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium*FDIV*bug)) into their products knowing they’ll eventually make their way, sleeper cell like, into the Big G logging/computation/map-reduce-democracy cluster, and there by sway the outcome of the global events.

In other news we’ve been experimenting with \[bucket test driven design\](http://www.walrusbucketsaga.com/), but there keep being \[heisenbugs\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unusual*software*bug). I might have also been reading Charlie’s \[How I got here in the end, part eleven: the music stops\](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/07/how*i*got*here*in*the*end*part*9.html).
