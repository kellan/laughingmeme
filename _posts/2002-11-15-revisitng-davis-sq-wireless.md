Right now, its a little irrelevant, as the rambling house/barn I’m staying at in New Hampshire is wirelessly enabled, but someday I’ll be returning to Boston, and the [Davis Sq. Community Wireless](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000206.html) will again be a neccessity.

The udpate is while the Greens/IMC will no longer be in their space, people have suggested that [Resist Foundation](http://www.resistinc.org) might be interested. This has the added advantage of being much closer to square, and being on the 2nd floor., and at [259 Elm St.](http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&addr=259+Elm+Street+&csz=Somerville+MA), I have to assume its right about Diesel at 257 Elm.
