With all the talk of weapons of mass destructions, terrorism, and evil over the last few years, today, the 59th anniversary of [bombing of Hiroshima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) might be a good day for reflection. On a related note if you haven’t seen it, you should watch McNamara’s <cite>Fog of War</cite>. Watching it was as close as I’ve come to understanding (not agreeing with) the decision made them then (and now) by our warlords. And this discussion of the fire bombing of Toyko helped me understand the scope of the destructions of both Toyko and Hiroshima, acts so beyond the normal human understanding as to unimaginable.
