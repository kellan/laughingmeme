Started using [bogofilter](http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/) yesterday. I didn’t have a huge folder full of spam lying around (SA died a while back) to train it on as suggested, so I’m just training it as they come. So far I’ve seen 30 spams, and it has caught 2.

Why do I mention this? Well it caught the first spam very quickly, but then it seemed not to be working. I was worried maybe my bogofilter was defective. Maybe it had a problem. But now with the second message I know its working, and just blooming slowly. I’m so excited. Its like a brand new tamagotchi, and this time I’m not going to let it die, I promise.
