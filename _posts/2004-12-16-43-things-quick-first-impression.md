If you liked [Twinkler](http://twinkler.43things.com/twinkler/), you should definitely sign up to beta [Hugster](http://robotcoop.com/weblog/42/) (a bushwoolie, apparently). At the very least it’s intriguing enough to kill a couple of hours playing with, making goals, and surfing the social networks.

I’m unclear how or if it might change how I work, but I’m very impressed that the Robot Coop kids have clearly put thought into getting information in and out of their system, not only is it not a roach motel, they aren’t insisting on “[being at the center of the star](http://blog.teledyn.com/node/2126)“. So while I don’t see it yet, definitely seems like there are the hooks and APIs to incorporate this into whatever my personal workflow is.

Plus it captures that elusive “fun” quality, and sports a styling [37 Signals](http://37signals.com) design.
