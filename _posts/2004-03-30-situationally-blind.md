Learned a new phrase, “situationally blind”, which seems to be [Richard Chassell](http://www.rattlesnake.com/) term for:

> people, such as car drivers, who should not be looking at your blog [or reading email] while driving – [Single Input — Multiple Outputs](http://www.rattlesnake.com/notions/multiple-output-preview.html) ([via](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/30/InputModes))
