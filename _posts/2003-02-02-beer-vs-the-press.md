SAB’s Castle Lager is not one of my fond memories from Cape Town, but you would think anything would be an improvement over MGD. However, SAB is also famous for something rather different, their involvement in the [Interbrew vs. press freedom case](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000071.html#000071). I’m glad to see the new era of ethical business is making such progress.
