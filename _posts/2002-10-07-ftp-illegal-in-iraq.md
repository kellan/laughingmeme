I really hate to add to the Iraq-bashing that goes on in blogs, but we just got word from a media activist in Iraq, who is trying to upload a video report, and they need a server that accepts HTTP upload. They wanted to use FTP, but FTP is illegal in Iraq. Only special government computers are allowed to use it.

I admit, I’m not really fond of the protocol either, but it does seem a bit extreme to make it illegal. And if you are going to make it illegal, then wouldn’t you want it to be especially illegal for government computers? Perhaps security wasn’t their primary concern.
