It started as a random idea on the train on Friday, but didn’t become real until yesterday afternoon (aka the first day of \[OSCON\](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/)) when \[Rabble\](http://anarchogeek.com) and I \[sat down\](http://anarchogeek.com/articles/2006/07/25/hacking-up-an-oscon-calendar-oscal) at \[Stumptown\](http://www.stumptowncoffee.com/) and banged out a new scheduling app.

\[OSCAL\](http://oscal.quxx.info/) is a tool for building a list of talks you’re interested in going to, and discovering what talks others are going to. Its a tag-enabled, all social, calendaring app, written in Rails, in about 6 hours. Take it for a spin, we like it.

Version 2.0 may or may not come out sometime tonight, with search, comments, user submitted events, and SMS notifications.

Version 2.0 or not though, the app worked, *I’m* much more excited about tomorrows sessions, and as you can see \[deeply divided about what to attend\](http://oscal.quxx.info/list/kellan)
