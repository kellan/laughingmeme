[moreLikeThis](http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/03012) has some interesting links about [Media Whores Online](http://www.mediawhoresonline.com/), a site that does media criticism, gonzo-style, using the scorched earth rhetorical style of the right wing pundits. Something like [FAIR](http://fair.org) channeling Limbaugh or Coulter.

It seems [Spinsanity](http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20020815.html) has taken then to task for engaging in the same underhanded dirty fighting we see on the right. Debate ensue! Check it out.
