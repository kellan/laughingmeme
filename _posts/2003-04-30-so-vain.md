So I punched ‘RSS’ into Scott’s [Feedster (aka Roogle)](http://feedster.com) sorted by date to see what was new, thinking I might find out about progress on the [ENT](http://matt.blogs.it/specs/ENT/1.0/) front, as people are already asking for [Mapgie](http://magpierss.sf.net) and [XML::RSS](http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS) (which doesn’t parse RSS 2.0 at all) to support it.

Well first, it took a **very** long time to return, I forgot the query was running (see previous post), but when I came back, the first result was [about Magpie](http://thelostolive.net/~kstamour/archives/000414.php)! So either Scott is doing some very impressive personalization (the ego boosting search engine), or Magpie is getting mindshare.

**update:** just noticed that entry on Magpie is from May 4th, 2003. No wonder its the top result when sorted by date. I knew I was falling behind, I’m still stuck in April. Must work to catch up.
