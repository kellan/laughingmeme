Sleepy Boston has 3 interesting events planned for May.

### OSCOM III, May 28 – 30, 2003. 

 The third [Open Source Content Management](http://www.oscom.org/Conferences/Cambridge/) conference will be held at Harvard this May. The theme is > Leveraging content with CMS: authoring and syndication towards the semantic web.

The report backs from last years conf in Berkeley were lack luster, but this seems more interesting. I feel like I should throw together a proposal for a talk on [open publishing](http://www.cat.org.au/maffew/cat/openpub.html) and [open editting](http://internal.protest.net/osi/index.php?OpenEditProposal). Interestingly there is a talk, [Samizdat: RDF model for an open publishing and cooperation engine](< http://www.oscom.org/Conferences/Cambridge/Proposals/boradenko_samizdat.html>) which mentions Active, and Mir, 2 of the primary Indymedia publishing tools. And [Mako](http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/makohill/diary) might be presenting his Div III work, though what exactly that is on is a bit of mystrey. ### [Cyberarts Festival](http://www.bostoncyberarts.com/), April 26 – May 11, 2003

 The festival 2 years ago was amazing, exhibits were all over the board from interactive fiction, to lazer displays, and kinetic sculpture. Its like open studios for geekiest intersection of arts and technology. One of the few, uniquely cool Boston events. (the marathon doesn’t count in my book) ### [eNarrative 5](http://www.enarrative.org/), May 10-11, 2003

 Is a subevent of the Boston Cyberarts Festival, organized by esteemed hypertextist [Mark Berstein](http://markbernstein.org/Feb0301.html#note_30844). Fascinating looking program, asks such questions as “information architecture: at war with art?”.
