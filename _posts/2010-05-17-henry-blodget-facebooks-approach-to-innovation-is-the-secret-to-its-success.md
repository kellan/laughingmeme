<http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-privacy-innovation-2010-5>

Blodget gets the headline right, and nearly everything else wrong.

I’m really surprised we aren’t seeing more people writing and talking about what I see as Facebook’s key competitive advantage: It’s a data driven company, which is nimble enough to act on that data.

When I look at the Facebook engineering culture I see the \[best parts of what we’ve done at Flickr\](http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr), scaled up in a way I didn’t think was possible.

And when you look at the work \[the data team\](http://www.facebook.com/data) is doing (which you can get a sense of by the \[tools they throw off\](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hive/43928506208)), you know that Facebook’s innovation is being tested, put through it’s paces, and extensively analyzed before most of us are aware of it.

This is a unique combination.
