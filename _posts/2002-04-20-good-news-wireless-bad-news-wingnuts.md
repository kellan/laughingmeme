Get me out of Santa Cruz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Good News: I **finally** discovered a wireless cafe in Santa Cruz.  
The Ugly Mug in Soquel, has an open access point, ESSID: mugnet 802.11b

Bad News: The people around me are seriously discussing whether or not the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was an artificial created. And theyâ€™ve decided it was! Plus the locusts in Afghanistan were introduced by the CIA to destory the poppy crop! Next up, mind control.
