If you’re a radical techie in or around Seattle (crews from Vancouver and Portland are coming) then you should to [CATS](http://cats.protest.net) this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, at the [IMC](http://seattle.indymedia.org/contact.php3).

CATS is an informal skill swap and socialize aimed at activists who are using technology in their work. Bring your own presentations, discussions, projects and hardware. Except conversations on collaboration, geek culture (and its negative impact on diversity), building secure webservers, VoIP (we’re all hoping someone will show up, and tell us all how its done), Debian NP, and whatever else people are moved to discuss.

See the [wiki](http://cats.protest.net/kwiki.cgi?HomePage) for some projects which people have said they would be willing to talk about (or have been volunteered to speak about)

Now and forever.
