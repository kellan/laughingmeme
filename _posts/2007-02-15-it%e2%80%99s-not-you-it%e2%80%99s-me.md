> “[Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com) has all the ingredients of something that should really set me off. Pipes, filters, mashups, RSS, Atom, RDF (singing) these are a few of my favorite things! So, what gives? Iâ€™m genuinely worried that I’m sick, depressed, losing it, or otherwise replaced by a pod alien. Possibly all the above. … So, it’s not you, it’s me.” – [Les – Thoughts on Pipes on the Web](http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web)
