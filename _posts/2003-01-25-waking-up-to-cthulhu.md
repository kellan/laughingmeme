It is a very strange day when 2 emails about Cthulhu land in your inbox, it is an even stranger day, when those 2 emails are about projects exploring the erotic aspects of Cthulhu. [Cthulhu Valentines (Reprint)](http://www.cartouchepress.com/postcards/cthulhuvalentines/) and [Cthulhu Sex Zine](http://www.cthulhusex.com/). Sharing in the hopes that someone else can make use of my bounty, as tentacles really arenâ€™t my thing.

Quick question, is it safe out there today? If I raise the blinds will I see Boston being ravaged by an Elder God? Do you think if I carried a white flag I could make it to Espresso Royale safely?
