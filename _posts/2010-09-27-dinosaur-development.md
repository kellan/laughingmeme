A friend recently described the going off and working on software for $N days/weeks/months and coming back with a finished projects as “being a dinosaur”.

The classic, anti-social highly focused development process as totally maladapted to our modern systems, tools, life cycles, and dependencies as the “great lizards” of old. I’m going to steal that.

It’s the exact opposite of Just Ship/Move Fast.
