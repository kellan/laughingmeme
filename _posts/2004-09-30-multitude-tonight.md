Just a reminder, if you aren’t watching that [beauty pageant tonight](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4052162) that will make pro-wrestling look unstaged and spontaneous, and you’re in or near Seattle, you might come to the [Michael Hardt reading](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002402.html) tonight at Kane Hall.

**update:** Apparently the AP sent out an article this morning [summarizing the results from tonights debate](http://www.timefornewmanagement.com/ap/theguardian.html), before the debates have taken place. ([more info](http://www.timefornewmanagement.com/ap/))
