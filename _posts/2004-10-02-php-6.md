[Adam Trachtenberg](http://www.trachtenberg.com/) lists Unicode support [as on his list for PHP 6.](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/42046) Got me thinking about **what else** is on my list for future versions of PHP.

Off the top of my head:

- closures
- and the closely related functions as first class objects
- namespaces
- [unless](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/09/30/a_minor_muddle_of_mental_models)

Iâ€™m sure there are others, but that is what I can think of at the moment. What are yours?
