According to Michale Eisner, Moore’s new film might [“endanger tax breaks Disney receives for its theme parks in Florida where Bush’s brother, Jeb, is governor”](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/national/05DISN.html?ex=1399089600&en=5dd82385da93ce1e&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND).

So next time you’re critiquing media consolidation, and some smug business man explains that consolidation is just about business, and doesn’t effect the content produced, I refer you to exhibit A here involving one of the world’s largest media companies, one of the world’s most respected studios, and one of the world’s most successful documentary film makers.

Less shocking but more chilling really is the off handed comment that Disney tried to kill the project last Spring, at which point it might have quietly disappeared, a reminder that for every piece of dissent you hear dozens were silenced before they got to you.

Frankly, I’m not sure we’ve got enough surplus freedom to start exporting it wholesale.

Moore also has [a brief messages](http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-05-04) on his blog this morning.

FAIR [has a follow up](http://www.fair.org/activism/disney-moore.html):
