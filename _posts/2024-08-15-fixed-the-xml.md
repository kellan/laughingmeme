I broke the XML on my [MLP Atom feed](https://laughingmeme.org/links/index.atom) with unescaped HTML. Good times. Retro. Very early this millennia vibe. 

I got to visit the [W3C Feed Validator](https://validator.w3.org/feed/) which is a time capsule of a site. Confirmed that modern news aggregators for the most part still don't rely on feeds to be valid XML. Except Slack. Slack's aggregator apparently does. Got me wondering if it was possibly still Magpie under the hood as it was in the early days but that seems extremely unlikely. 

Anyway, the feed should be back on.
