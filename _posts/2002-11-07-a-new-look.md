### aka., Expirementing with the Performative Nature of Online Identity

I couldn’t take the old look anymore, and it was restricting the amount and type of information I could put on the page. Jasmine did some sketches for an entirely new look, but until she has some free time, I’m going to go with this very nice, and lightly tweaked, default MT look. I hope I won’t just become another anonymous face in the sea of websites. Still working out some the kinks, and design issues, small changes over the next day or so. Now I’ve put off coffee and food for much too long.
