So Yada, the server that hosts both LaughingMeme and [Protest.net](http://protest.net) is being pounded in anticipation of events this weekend, in New York and elsewhere. This partially a problem of poorly written code (the site software behind Protest.net is about 3 years over due for an overhaul) partially too little memory in the box (it could use another 500M) and partially too much damn traffic. I hate wars, everytime it looks like we’re going to have a war, our load jumps to like 400. Its so annoying, just cut it out with the war mongering, I’m not sysadmin enough to handle it.

Coverage has already started rolling in over at [NYC IMC](http://nyc.indymedia.org/) in anticipation.

Speaking of NYC IMC, I just got my [Threat to Peace](http://www.indypendent.org) poster tonight, and its amazing. (hmmm, the Indypendent server is also having load trouble)
