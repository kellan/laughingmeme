Yesterday was my last day of daily commute to Sunnyvale!

Good friends will be missed (we’re working on dragging them up to the city with us), but I leave for New York tomorrow, and when I get back (first week of Nov.) Flickr will be lodged in our SF office.

At that point I hope I’ll actually have the time to catch up with all the folks here in the city whom I haven’t caught up with in the 6 months since I’ve been here.
