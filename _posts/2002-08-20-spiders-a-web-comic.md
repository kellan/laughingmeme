I’m not entirely sure what to say about [Spiders](http://www.e-sheep.com/spiders/), except it is one of the most innovative things I’ve seen on the web in a long time. And fascinating. And a comic. And you should be reading it. This is web art that is approachable and understandable in contrast with the surreal silliness of something like Zuper, and yet equally it also revels in the medium.
