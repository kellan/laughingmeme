I swear there used to be more posts in the “blogosphere” like Sam Ruby’s [Agile Web 2.0 Development](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/08/08/Agile-Web-2-0-Development).

I miss those posts. Seems like maybe everybody is too busy doing these days to write. And so perhaps that vital cross pollination, reflection, socializing and theorizing which is going to make Web 2.0 so different then Web 1.0 is no longer happening. (as much) Or maybe I’m just melancholy.
