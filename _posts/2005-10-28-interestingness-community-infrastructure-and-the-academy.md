In the “few thoughts, loosely joined” school, Anil’s recent post \[The Interesting Economy\](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/10/25/the\_interesting), got me revisiting worn grooves, thinking about \[community\](http://laughingmeme.org/tag/community+service).

Anil posits that \[Flickr’s\] users, creators of value and “interestingness” are getting short changed, or at least in the future our understanding of Flickr’s value proposition will lead us to conclude their users are being short changed. It’s part of an ongoing struggle to define our norms around participation, community, hosted tools, and ownership. (On a side note, syndication can mix into this explosively, as with this \[thread last Summer on Meetup and EVDB\](http://www.meetup.com/boards/view/viewthread?thread=1451982&amp;pager.offset=0))

Actually Anil’s point was more interesting and more subtle, and worth reading, but as the signal \[bounced around the echo chamber\](http://technorati.com/search/dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2005%2F10%2F25%2Fthe\_interesting), it degraded into “Hey, **I** make Flickr interesting, pay **me**!”.

I mean as software tends towards commodification (\[as t approaches 0\](http://www.toolshed.com/blog/articles/2005/09/15/what-happens-when-t-approaches-0)), clearly Flickr derives its value from its participants, yes?

No. Quite the opposite.

I could replicate Flickr’s software (call it Flickah, a Boston Flickr derivative), give it away free, and still people would pay to be part of Flickr. And in fact if I ever managed to grow the community to a fraction of Flickr’s size I’d be in trouble. Flickr isn’t a photo hosting site, it’s a salon, and unsurprisingly value accumulates most quickly to the salon owner. Value arises from the centralization.

### Community Service Models?

So assuming software, what alternatives models exist for a community to host a service they find useful? How do communities gain and support the values of centralization without handing over control? A \[Flickr\], an \[Upcoming\](http://upcoming.org), or an \[Audioscrobbler\](http://audioscrobbler.com) provide value in direct proportion to the size of the community, while the centralization of a Google Maps (or a Geocoder) makes an expensive resource affordable. It’s a question I’ve been \[wrestling with for a while\](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2004/08/31/community-services) (\[community+service\](http://laughingmeme.org/tag/community+service)). And a question I asked at \[techdinner\](http://del.icio.us/tag/techdinner) recently to surprising results.

I expected to hear about grid computing, alternate economic models, p2p, etc. Instead it was suggested that maintaining such a resource, or at least some subset of such community resources is the role of the Academy in the 21st century. (less surprising given the presence of \[Berkman-ites\](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/) in the crowd)

Perhaps not a Google Maps, or Flickr but maybe Harvard should be hosting the \[definitive URI for books\](http://laughingmeme.org/articles/2003/01/04/a-definitive-uri-for-books)? I was intrigued. (not to mention a little appalled given my stint doing tech for Higher Ed.)

Last thought, in the multitude responses to Anil, it was pointed out that interestingness can be gamed, as can most deployed reputation systems. Yet eBay works? How? By making buy in into the system cost real cash, something \[Flickr print\](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/10/your*photos*on\_.html) is poised to do. As a print service not terribly exciting, but what a great way to quantify interestingness.
