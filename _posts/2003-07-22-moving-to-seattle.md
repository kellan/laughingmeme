Despite what I might have told you, it looks like I **might** be moving to Seattle very soon after all. (Not going to work for Microsoft)

Which brings me to one of my least favorite tasks in the whole world…finding housing. I’m looking for suggestions in terms of resources (is Craigslist the way to go? is there a native alternative?), and neighorhoods (young, happening, coffee shops, good food markets, bike/public transporation friendly). Work would be near Seattle Pacific University, and I’m a non-driver.

Also anything else I should know about the city?
