In 2 weeks it will have been a year since Jasmine and I [participated in a Spencer Tunick shoot in Chinatown](http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000040.html#000040) to benefit Art in General, and celebrate the cool emerging arts gallery’s 20th year. In recognition of: the 350 odd days that have passed, the recent acquisition of an appropiate frame, and the friends who have since given up on me, I didn’t scan the print I recieved for my participation… but I did the next best thing. [I took a picture of it.](http://gallery.laughingmeme.org/misc/IMG_0393) And no I didn’t, as threatened, circle us, or draw big red arrows. You’ll just have to visit for that.

Also does anyone know if the interior shot worked out at all? Was it ever printed and displayed?
