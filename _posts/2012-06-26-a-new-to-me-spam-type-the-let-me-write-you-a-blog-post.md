> An idea for a blog post: Aesthetics of Learning

> Hi Kellan,

> I found the information on your blog http://laughingmeme.org/ insightful as I was scouring the web for research on historical topics that are relevant to issues in higher education today. One of the biggest hurdles in completing an enriching and useful college degree (especially with different organizations such as online schools bombarding students with options) has been the lack of innovation in learning today. I believe that for students today to truly retain useful knowledge, it’s important to design curriculums keeping in mind aesthetics and learning theory.
