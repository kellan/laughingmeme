Read \[Rick’s\](http://rickwebb.tumblr.com/post/106007409729/the-books-i-read-in-2014), \[Rachel’s\](https://medium.com/content-consciousness/books-i-read-in-2014-47f528451836) and \[Diana’s\](http://blog.dianakimball.com/post/106214213693) year end book list, and got inspired to write up my own.

2014 was a year of extenuating circumstances, the most obvious being the arrival of Anwen 9 hours before it began, but numerous others large and small abound. Reading this year was centered around escape, even oblivion, in short doses, and re-reading featured prominently.

(also I finally forwent the urge to build a Kindle exporter as part of this process and just used \[clippings.io\](https://www.clippings.io) which did the job well, though seems to have hit a problem after downloading nearly 2400 highlights)

Additionally I’ve probably missed a couple which I didn’t highlight anything in (or read exclusively in dead tree)

1. The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot by Robert Macfarlane
    
    > Pilgrim paths, green roads, drove roads, corpse roads, trods, leys, dykes, drongs, sarns, snickets – say the names of paths out loud and at speed and they become a poem or rite – holloways, bostles, shutes, driftways, lichways, ridings, halterpaths, cartways, carneys, causeways, herepaths.
    > 
    > In Ireland there are hundreds of miles of famine roads, built by the starving during the 1840s to connect nothing with nothing in return for little, unregistered on Ordnance Survey base maps. In the Netherlands there are doodwegen and spookwegen – death roads and ghost roads – which converge on medieval cemeteries. Spain has not only a vast and operational network of cañada, or drove roads, but also thousands of miles of the Camino de Santiago, the pilgrim routes that lead to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela. In Scotland there are clachan and rathad – cairned paths and shieling paths – and in Japan the slender farm tracks that the poet Bash? followed in 1689 when writing his Narrow Road to the Far North

7. The Peripheral, William Gibson
    
    > “Terrorism,” said the rental. “We prefer not to use that term,” said Lowbeer, studying her candle flame with something that looked to Netherton to be regret, “if only because terror should remain the sole prerogative of the state.”

    > 
    > In November of 1966 there was a flood in Florence, killing six people and damaging some property. Fortunately the weather computers had predicted it well in advance, so most people had evacuated and most works of art were moved to safety. Some frescos were damaged. Pat wrote articles about their restoration and sat on a committee to raise money for it.
    > 
    > Just the cold contingent universe where things happened for random reasons nobody could understand.
30. Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty
    
    > Expert analysis will never put an end to the violent political conflict that inequality inevitably instigates.
31. Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, Book 2), Brandon Sanderson
    
    > “If I toss something upward, it comes back down.” “Except when it doesn’t.” “It’s a law.” “No,” Syl said, looking upward. “It’s more like . . . more like an agreement among friends.
32. The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, Book 1), Brandon Sanderson
    
    > Shallan moved her eyes down to the bottom of the page where—separated by a line—the undertext was written in a small, cramped script. Most books dictated by men had an undertext, notes added by the woman or ardent who scribed the book. By unspoken agreement, the undertext was never shared out loud. Here, a wife would sometimes clarify—or even contradict—the account of her husband. The only way to preserve such honesty for future scholars was to maintain the sanctity and secrecy of the writing.
    > 
    > When he passed, the timid grass pulled back, but the fingermoss was bolder. The clumps would only pull into their shells if he tapped the rock near them.
33. Moneyball, Michael Lewis
34. Liar’s Poker (Norton Paperback), Michael Lewis
    
    > Why did investment banking pay so many people with so little experience so much money?

    > “When we drove off the cliff, we left no skid marks.
    > 
    > The people who stay will care deeply about how you treat their colleagues.
    > 
    > Yes, of course. The reason that people leave our service and don’t come back is that we have not been sending them enough spam. That makes total sense to me, too.
    > 
    > Shock is a great mechanism for behavioral change.
    >

    > Nature’s not talking, possibly because even nature realizes that giving perfect camouflage to apex predators is sort of a dick move.

    > (Australia. The only continent designed with a difficulty rating of “ha ha fuck you no.”)
39. Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders, L. David Marquet
    
    > Most of what we study, learn, and practice in terms of leadership today follows this leader-follower structure. This model has been with us for a long time. It is pervasive. It is the structure depicted in The Iliad, in Beowulf, and in other Western epics. But this model developed during a period when mankind’s primary work was physical. Consequently, it’s optimized for extracting physical work from humans. Those who take orders usually run at half speed, underutilizing their imagination and initiative. While this doesn’t matter much for rowing a trireme, it’s everything for operating a nuclear-powered submarine.
40. The Privilege of the Sword (The World of Riverside Book 2), Ellen Kushner
    
    > “I do not make the rules,” he said creamily. “This annoys me, and so I comfort myself by breaking them.

    > 
    > And suddenly, as the night air turned cold and the day sky burned a bright and gallant blue, the world was full of apples. The air smelt of them, sharp and crisp, then underlaid with the sweet rot of groundfall.
    > 
    > Serious sword-practice made me forget to think in words, so that I didn’t always understand when people spoke to me.
41. What’s Going on in There?: How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of Life, Lise Eliot
42. Influx, Daniel Suarez
    
    > “Mankind was on the moon in the 1960s, Jon. That was half a century ago. Do you really think the pinnacle of innovation since that time is Facebook? They designed the Saturn V rocket with slide rules.
43. Abaddon’s Gate (The Expanse Book 3), James S.A. Corey
    
    > She had a sudden vision of Jesus, who’d asked His disciples to keep doing this in remembrance of Him, watching her little congregation as they floated in microgravity and drank reconstituted grape beverage out of suction bulbs. It seemed to stretch the boundaries of what He’d meant by this.

47. The Golem and the Jinni (P.S.), Helene Wecker
    
    > Gradually the well-kept brownstones gave way to Dutch clapboard houses, their trellises heavy with roses.
    > 
    > He supposed that eventually Matthew would grow older and lose interest, and take his place with the feral young men who slouched on the neighborhood stoops. Or—even worse—he’d become just another streetcar rider, dull-eyed and unprotesting.
48. The Boy Kings: A Journey into the Heart of the Social Network, Katherine Losse
    
    > Logging on to Facebook that first day, in retrospect, was the second, and to date the last, time that any technology has captured my imagination.
    > 
    > “California is a place in which a boom mentality and a sense of Chekhovian loss meet in uneasy suspension; in which the mind is troubled by some buried but ineradicable suspicion that things better work here, because here, beneath the immense bleached sky, is where we run out of continent.
    > 
    > While they abhorred the idea of being a wage slave, the young men of Silicon Valley were not trying to tear down the capitalist system. They were trying to become its new masters.
49. Neptune’s Brood, Charles Stross
    
    > Which means I need to brief you on the politics of mermaids.
