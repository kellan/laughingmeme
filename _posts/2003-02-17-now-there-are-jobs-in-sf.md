I should stop posting, and go do something, but it was a weird long day, and Iâ€™m kind of trapped inside. But can I tell you how frustrating this is? Jasmine and I were in San Francisco for a year, and there was nothing remotely resembling work available, now since I moved back east (what 2 months ago?) there have been 3 dream opportunities, and numerous other possiblities, including taking over for a friend at a prominent community site who gave his notice this week. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

In the mean time there is nothing out here.
