I was much more actively, and exhaustively involved with FLOSS then with FOO, not to mention I was already operating from a point of sleep deprivation, and over socialization. So I’m going to point you to [Eugene’s excellent write up](http://www.eekim.com/blog/2005/08/26/xu200508redux).

I do however want to call out [Rashmi](http://www.rashmisinha.com/), who was the information architect at the event, has a [great blog](http://www.rashmisinha.com/), and is definitely on the cutting edge thinking about IA, and about the intersection of [IA and open source](http://www.rashmisinha.com/archives/05\_04/open-source.html).
