Apologies in advance for those who find it irritating.</p>

<p>Had a call with <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/">Jesse</a> the other week and we discussed how we’re <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2026/02/03/managing-agents/">speed running the last few decades of engineering management</a>. The swarm craze of the last few weeks bringing us solidly up to Fred Brooks.</p>

<p>Writing about software development over the years has always suffered from at least two key challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the vast majority of the writing suffers from survivor bias and serves as a record of something that worked for <em>this particular set of humans</em> in <em>this particular set of circumstances</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>most of the writing has implicitly assumed a highly rational, implacable, rule following software engineer completely at odds with all the software engineers I’ve known (and wildly at odds with the best of them)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But if our software theories often assumed emotionally and morally stunted automatons with limitless patience, might they be useful in today’s context?</p>

<ul>
  <li>TDD, always hit and miss for humans, clearly works well for agents.</li>
  <li>The folks I’ve spoken with who are experimenting with maximalist approaches to agentic coding talk a lot about components and isolation in ways that remind me of microservices (terrible for humans), and CORBA before it.</li>
  <li>Bake-offs (the agent might get attached to their implementation, but only for the space of that shell)</li>
  <li>Sub-agents have <em>some</em> of the insights of pair programming encoded in the practice, enough that it makes me wonder about the rest of the XP toolkit.</li>
  <li>UML and Rational Rose coming back?</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder what else from the scrap heap is worth poking at?</p>

I like to say (and it may even be true) that stopping and pivoting the team to standardizing on PHP was critical to unlocking everything that came later at Etsy. After all, no one ever has to argue about what elegant PHP looks like.</p>

<p>We’ve <em>always</em> had this tension. We’ve always fetishized the act of writing code, the quality of the code, the code as the primary artifact and IP. And on the other hand successful teams have <em>always</em> known that the value is the system, the value is human-technology hybrid that allows a product to be delivered, meet customer needs, evolve to provide more value over time, meet the spoken and unspoken needs of the problem domain, etc. This confusion in our thinking has laid at the heart of why, for example, technical hiring was such a disaster for so long. (Hiring continues to be terrible but it’s actually <em>much</em> better than it used to be. We now make fun of teams that ask you to reverse a linked list on a whiteboard while evaluating if they’d like to have a beer with you. That used to be the norm)</p>

<p>Said another way, we’ve known for a <em>long</em> time that code is the easy part. Has arguably <em>always</em> been the easy part, but certainly has been the easiest part of building software for the last several decades.</p>

<p>Yes: this is a genuinely new moment.</p>

<p>Yes: the last 3-4 months of frontier models, and Claude Code and its ilk are genuinely something new in the world.</p>

<p>Yes: the cost of producing code is plunging towards something near to zero faster than almost any of us can imagine, and that’s going to require a ton of change.</p>

<p>Yes: it’s already breaking social contracts and requiring rethinking about how teams work together. (<a href="https://siddhantkhare.com/writing/ai-fatigue-is-real">Review is <em>fatiguing</em> in a way that creating is not</a>, something else we’ve known for a while.)</p>

<p>Also yes: I’m feeling the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/6/tom-dale/">dissociative awe at the temporal compression of change</a>.</p>

<p>But code being the easy and cheap part is not new.</p>

<p>Technology changes requiring us to rethink our social contracts and how our teams work is not new.</p>

<p>The web, CI/CD, large scale sites, mobile, SPAs, machine learning and data, all of these broke how teams worked and required us to invent new ways of working.</p>

<p>I think it’s fascinating to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/">read about running a dark software factory with a team of 3 people</a>. I think as a leader with a much larger (though comparatively small) team of humans I’m going to need to be equally creative on the right way to incorporate humans rather than exclude them from the process. And honestly those conversations are fun. It’s been a <em>while</em> since we’ve gotten to throw all the pieces up in the air and see what works.</p>

<p>It’s reasonable to be skeptical of AI because so much of the hype around it, and so many of the people hyping it (and profiting from it) are also at the nexus of the most amoral and sometimes out right evil aspect of how capital has transformed tech. (Does anyone else miss when tech was funded by nice, morally uncomplicated actors, like the US Department of Defense, back when it was still called the Department of Defense)</p>

<p>It’s also reasonable for people who entered technology in the last couple of decades because it was good job, or because they enjoyed coding to look at this moment with a real feeling of loss. That feeling of loss though can be hard to understand emotionally for people my age who entered tech because we were addicted to feeling of agency it gave us. The web was objectively awful as a technology, and genuinely amazing, and nobody got into it because programming in Perl was somehow aesthetically delightful. (The language is referred to as write only line noise for a reason)</p>

<p>The cost of code is going to zero. That’s genuinely neat, and mind blowing, and going to require reinventing so many things. It was still never the hard part.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kellan Elliott-McCrea</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I joined Etsy the team was two years into a rewrite chasing a more elegant architecture (actually two distinct incompatible elegant architectures), and hadn’t shipped a customer facing feature in that time.

I used the opportunity to reach <em>way back</em> in the spark file for a silly side project, a web app for browsing NYC’s street trees.</p>

<p><img src="/img/spark-trees-near-you.jpg" /></p>

<p>This project has been on my todo list for a long time (probably even before the 2016 date I have written down here). I was inspired by <a href="https://www.treesnearyou.com/">Trees Near You</a>, an awesome hack from <a href="https://www.brettcamper.com/">Brett Camper</a> at a hackathon the city threw to promote its new open data initiatives (back when NYC did that kind of thing). At some point Apple changed some APIs and Brett’s awesome app stopped working and I conceived the notion to rebuild it for the web.</p>

<p>Now this project is largely pointless, because in the intervening decade <a href="https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/">NYC Parks has launched an excellent website to serve just this purpose</a>. But it’s a fun, self contained little project, and I’ve picked up a couple of different times to try out new technology. (The React and React Native versions never really worked. A version I tried to build with Claude’s help in 2023 on Svelte mostly worked locally in Chrome, but never on Safari or in production). With Claude Code this time I got further.</p>

<p>So here is a <a href="https://treesnyc.onrender.com/">simple Trees NYC web app</a>. Relatively vanilla Javascript, SQLite backend. Please enjoy New Yorks 650k+ trees.</p>

<p>I’ve got <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude Code</a> running in the background while I tab between writing this, sipping a Powers, and fielding phone calls from a team slightly panicked about the end of quarter QBR. This blog post is being written on May 27th, 2025, things may have changed by the time you read it. It was a toss up whether to post this on <a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/">Notes on engineering leadership</a>, or here, but eventually decided this was too loose for even Notes low standards. You’ve been warned (or at least given a context window with which to understand the remaining blog post).</p>

<p>LLMs are without a doubt the most disruptive change to how code gets written I’ve seen in my career since the introduction of the World Wide Web. As someone who largely <em>started</em> on the web at a time when most people weren’t, I remember reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dobb%27s_Journal">Dr. Dobb’s</a> 30 years ago and seeing all these ads for weird C++ binaries I could pay to include in binaries I shipped on CDs. (Jokes on me as I now work at a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">company</a> that has C++ in production that dates to that era). That said, as of today, LLMs don’t change some key fundamental physics of writing code as a team. Importantly, as of today, they haven’t changed the fundamental calculation that writing code is always easier than understanding code.</p>

<p>The insight that reading code is harder than writing leads naturally to the insight that <a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt">every line of code is tech debt</a>. Every line of code encodes your best current understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve (for increasingly weird definitions of “you”). Nothing has changed the fact that your current understanding is probably limited, and wrong in several ways.</p>

<h3 id="updating-your-mental-model-even-harder-for-llms-than-for-engineers">Updating your mental model even harder for LLMs than for engineers</h3>

<p>If you’ve ever had the questionable joy of participating in a “technological transformation” (whether or not it was called that) than you’ve had the specific experience of how challenging it is to convince an engineering team to give up on its current test suite (for extremely variable values of “test suite”). It doesn’t matter how much you argue that the test suite is a product of the practices and understanding of the problem you’re trying to over turn. And you’ll have this same conversation iterated for each historical technical decision (but especially tests). I’ve gone through the process of convincing a toddler to give up their pacifier, and convincing engineers to give up their tests, and I’d choose reasoning with the 2 year old any day of the week.</p>

<p>LLMs are more challenging. As soon as you instruct them to start building context from an existing codebase, you’re in a battle to change their mind about what’s important. From tests, to schemas, to dependencies. Given the lack of explicit tools for operating on their internal model, it’s a shockingly similar process to convincing an engineer (I should note the approaches that work with a toddler <em>do not work</em> with LLMs, in particular bribery is largely a failure).</p>

<p>The saving grace for engineers is the handful of folks who through inclination or trauma either believe in a better world or just want to see the current world burn and are therefore inclined to radical departures. My experimental data suggests telling LLMs they “just want to watch the world burn” does not make them more comfortable deleting obsolete test cases.</p>

<h3 id="nih-wasnt-invented-here-but-we-did-perfect-it">NIH wasn’t invented here, but we did perfect it.</h3>

<p>Current generations of LLM are very happy to write you a new function for functionality you already have in your codebase. Your tips on incantations to add to CLAUDE.md to change this behavior welcome. Just telling it “DRY” ain’t getting the job done. (and honestly, <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontRepeatYourself">DRY</a> was always problematic advice that lead to premature abstraction, and that was before the nightmare that was dependency injection). Code bases with significant AI contribution are … bushy. Arguably as long as no humans are required to reason about the codebase we’re fine. It does preclude, practically from first principles, those exceptional individuals many of us have encountered in our career who seemed to be able to hold the entire code base in their brains. Arguably that’s a net positive. Those individuals were always problematic similar to those folks who are willing to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=heroes+considered+harmful">work 80 hours a week and jump on every incident</a>. At a minimum they make the rest of us look bad. But it’s still an arms race between the LLM and itself. I may be skeptical of TDD as a human practice, but as a LLM practices it’s the gold standard. But if every member of your team has their own bespoke approach to common functionality is your test suite doing its job? At a minimum you’re burning a lot of Github Actions CPU. And that’s before you ponder what does the response to <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-44228">Log4Shell</a> look like in a world where everyone on your team has their own NIH bespoke logging code?</p>

<h3 id="a-small-number-of-well-known-tools--if-it-was-opposite-day">A Small Number of Well Known Tools … if it was opposite day.</h3>

<p>Highly productive engineering teams (historically) reach that productivity by building a deep expertise in their tool chain. This is why it is so critical to closely examine <a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/new-tech">introducing new technologies</a> to your stack. An under examined cost of complicated technologies is that the cost of defining the preferred subset of capabilities falls on each development team instead of the industry as a whole. For example think about how every team that uses a “big language” (like Typescript or Scala) defines their own local subset, or paucity of Postgres best practices vs MySQL. <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt">TIMTOWTDI</a> isn’t actually a good thing. (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included">“batteries included”</a> definitely won that argument) LLMs radically lower the cost of writing code (already the cheapest part of software development). With LLMs it is often easier to code an approach than research one. The exploding ecological diversity in our software environments is breathtaking.</p>

<h3 id="where-were-at-today">Where we’re at today</h3>

<p>Local, bespoke, unique, noisy, bushy, <em>big</em> codebases seem like the inevitable byproduct of our current tools and models. It’s possible that LLMs can be shaped into tools that making code reading and code reasoning more powerful; that help us refactor, refine, and reduce the complexity of our codebases. I’m certainly encouraging my team to experiment with what is possible. Lowering the cost of <em>writing</em> code was the thing that no engineering leader asked for, but it’s the thing we got.</p>

<p>How are you changing your leadership practices in the face of LLMs?</p>

<p>I’m quite confident I’m not the first person to want to do something like this. But we’ve reached an awkward and unfortunate moment in the Web’s journey where search just doesn’t work very well anymore. Except searching the latent information space of a LLM trained on the entire Web actually works unreasonably well for this sort of thing. Meaning, it is easier to write your own than find an existing solution. That’s going to have all sorts of weird consequences I’m sure.</p>

<p>So here’s my script, <a href="https://gist.github.com/kellan/2a8ff0e614ae96034f5592513f9a717a">gdrive-to-s3.py</a>. It use the <a href="https://googleapis.github.io/google-api-python-client/docs/epy/googleapiclient.http.MediaIoBaseDownload-class.html">MediaIoBaseDownload</a> API to fetch files in byte ranges from Gdrive and multi-part S3 uploads which in combination remove the need to read any of these 10Gb files directly into memory or store then locally (either of which would rather rules out running the script on a t2.micro) and instead allows you to stream the data from one storage provider to another in manageable chunk sizes.</p>

<p>Like many people I’ve been dealing with the collapses of the various systems I relied on for information over the previous decades. After 17 of using Twitter daily and 24 years of using Google daily neither really works anymore. And particular with the <a href="https://laughingmeme.org/2024/05/12/what-we-mean-to-others.html">collapse of the social spaces many of us grew up with</a>, I feel called back to earlier forms of the Internet, like blogs, and in particular, starting a link blog.</p>

<p>This is the very definition of something that no one needs. Technology doesn’t work like this, you can’t solve today’s problems by slavish devotion to earlier forms, its one-way doors all the way down. And certainly no one needs <em>my</em> link blog. I don’t really consume that much media from that many varied sources.</p>

<p>But I’m impressed by the folks who never stopped, <a href="https://www.somebits.com/linkblog/">Nelson</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon</a>, <a href="https://waxy.org/category/links/">Andy</a>, <a href="https://kottke.org/">Jason</a>, and figure that there is value in the doing, for myself if no one else.</p>

<h3 id="colophon">Colophon</h3>

<p>When dinosaurs roamed the Earth we had books printed on paper by a publisher called <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O’Reilly</a>, and in the back there were notes about how the books were made, and they called it a colophon. That’s this section of the blog post.</p>

<p>When dinosaurs roamed the Earth there was also a site called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memepool">memepool</a> which for all intents and purposes grew up to become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)">del.icio.us</a>, and there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin">Kuro5hin</a> (a response to Slashdot), which had a section called “Mindless Link Propagation” or MLP. That term has always stuck with me, and all the various attempts to put link blogs on Laughing Meme over the last 20+ years have been called MLP. And while del.icio.us was ground to dust by being acquired by Yahoo, we still have <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard.in</a> (which thankfully appears to be largely self sustaining because the maintainer seems to have gone quiet – now that’s good engineering).</p>

<p>Kuro5hin is long gone, but it’s creator, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/style/today-in-tabs-rusty-foster-media-gossip-maine.html">Rusty Foster</a> is better known these days for <a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/">Today in Tabs</a>, and so there is someone else who never gave up the links game.</p>

<p>So those are the inspirations: it’s called MLP, and it’s powered by Pinboard.</p>

<p>And in the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/jedi-build-thei.html">grand tradition of those long ago days</a>, the first step was to <a href="https://github.com/kellan/blogmarks">write my own software to do power all of this</a>. I borrowed heavily from Nelson.</p>

<p>A Github Action fetches tags from Pinboard with <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kellan/t:mlp/">“mlp”</a> and stores it in a local Sqlite db and checks that into the repo. A another action generates the HTML. A third action, over in the main repo for this blog, fetches the generated HTML and combines it with the Jekyll output for this blog and pushes it to Github Pages. Additional metadata is layered into <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/51035612836@N01/discuss/72157594497877875/">“machine tags”</a>.</p>

<p>This follows on <a href="https://laughingmeme.org/2024/05/14/minor-blog-updates.html">my post from last month on discovering Github Actions</a> (half a decade after they launched) and deciding to use it as aggregator, lambda, and cron job. It’s a slow debug cycle, and fiddly YAML, and requires you to hold a very specific mental model of a filesystem you never see, and really is in no way superior to the technologies we hewed from stone and wood in the early days of blogging, but I kind of like it. It was a fun puzzle getting it to work. Kind of like when you have one of those tavern puzzles. You can pretend you sat down and looked at the thing to solve it, but really we all just fiddle until the ring slides over the horseshoe.</p>

<p>I’ll be continuing to futz. But if you consume the whole thing with a well formed feed reader you shouldn’t see the thrash.</p>

<p>We’ll see. The point of link blogging, for me, is the doing. So I’m looking forward to learning what I’ll blog about.</p>

<p>That said, some of my persistent interests right now are climate optimism, and separating the wheat and chaff of the transformative technologies that are transformers and LLMs from the abusive hype cycle at the heart of Silicon Valley that has latched on to this tech as its latest scam.</p>

<p>This weekend I sat down to make it so that HTML generation could run on demand somewhere in the cloud with the rough idea that maybe an AWS Lambda was the answer. In evaluating my options I did what any senior and sophisticated engineering leader would do, I asked ChatGPT. Among the 4 options it suggested was Github Actions, which definitely felt like the most straightforward.</p>

<p>This was my first time ever using Github Actions directly versus vaguely overseeing a team using it, and I was impressed by what good kit it is. Nice to be up-to-date with cutting edge technology circa 2018.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/kellan/laughingmeme/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml">my workflow file that runs my tweaked version of Jekyll on every commit and push it to the gh-pages branch</a>. At first I thought I’d keep rsync’ing the generated output to the Linode host, and with a bit of poking and prodding I got that working as a GH Actions as well, but in the end it was just easier to host the site on Pages.</p>

<p>Did we first meet in the 90s providing tech support for tree sitters? Or was it in a muddy field in the Netherlands laying fiber optic cable for a 2001 hackers conference? Or at the Other Side Cafe in Boston debating whether it made sense use RDF as the basis for a syndication format and should it still be called RSS at that point? Oh, it was a Perl conference in Japan, that’s right, I had forgotten about that.</p>

<p>Much like Gen X is sometimes the forgotten generation (or at least we feel that way), the generation of us who grew up with an internet that seemed an unalloyed good fall awkwardly into the middle between those who didn’t grow up with it, and those for whom there has always been the whiff of brimstone, greed, and ruin around the place.</p>

<p>Weddings and their ilk are excellent heritage technologies for reconnecting with community but in mingling it was clear that for so many of us who grew up building our community with the help of prosthestics in the form of social software we find ourselves bereft a bit as the tools slow and then all at once collapse.</p>

<p>Discussion turned as it does in such crowds to whether there is a tool to build (“Does Signal have an API?” “Is email the appropriate technology?”), but for me the key insight was something the officiant (the delightful Yoz Grahame) said during the ceremony.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we get older, and let’s face it we got old, it’s easy to forget what we mean to other people. - Yoz Grahame</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/16/software-and-its-discontents-part-1.html">part 1</a>, I wrote about how the macro-economic environment is driving the timing of this conversation, and in particular the impact that a decade of cheap money had on how we build software, and what the end of that decade means.  In <a href="https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/23/software-and-its-discontents-part-2-complexity.html">part 2</a>, I explored how building software is counter-intuitively harder today than ever, because the complexity of building software has exploded. This post will build on part 1 and part 2 to talk about how the economics of employing a team of software engineers has changed. </p>

<h3 id="an-aside-layoffs-suck">An aside: layoffs suck</h3>

<p>Layoffs suck. I’ve written about them a bit in <a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/layoff-foundations">Building Layoffs on a Healthy Foundation</a>. If you were recently laid off, especially if you’re vulnerable to our capricious immigration system, you have my sympathy, and please don’t hesitate to ask on the off chance there is something I can do to help. </p>

<p>It is awkward to write about reducing working in tech just to its economic mechanics at the exact moment when many of the most successful and profitable companies in our industry are doing layoffs. My hope for this series is to help people understand this system and how it’s changing, in order to have better tools for shaping the outcomes. Especially for the estimated 50% of the industry who joined in the last 10 years and have known only boom conditions. </p>

<h3 id="getting-paid">Getting paid</h3>

<p>As the boss in <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/macroeconomic-changes-have-made-it-impossible-for-me-to-want-to-pay-you">the recent McSweeney’s article said</a>, “I wish I wanted to pay you, but I don’t.” As a sometimes boss myself, I might say it with more nuance. Let’s assume we all agree that everyone deserves food, shelter, education, health, and meaningful dignified work. (though that is very much not the case in our society). As a boss I can either pay you out of the sustainable profits our company generates or I can compensate you with the money the market has lent me in the form of our company’s valuation. In tech companies, in general, we’re compensated inline with our company’s valuation, which is often many multiples larger than our profits (assuming we have any). Those multiples are driven by Silicon Valley’s (and the SV-adjacent ecosystem’s) special relationship with software.</p>

<h3 id="asymptotic-return-to-scale-is-the-key-math-behind-tech-salaries">Asymptotic return to scale is the key math behind tech salaries</h3>

<p>The Silicon Valley model, at its most basic, is that we spend a relatively small fixed cost upfront to develop software, and then each new customer has near zero marginal cost – they’re just another row in the database after all. In this model once you’ve acquired enough customers to pay back your initial investment all the subsequent customers are pure profit (and that profit can be reinvested into further improving your product and protecting your base). At scale this becomes a machine for printing money. Contrast this to selling a physical product. In that model you have to pay for materials and labor for each and every widget you manufacture.</p>

<p>The equation of low fixed cost and scaling with near zero marginal cost is why “scale” is such a power word in our industry, and justifies ongoing investments in tech that otherwise boggle the mind. </p>

<p>However, as the decade of cheap money recedes, we see that the equation changed while no one was looking.</p>

<h3 id="tech-talent-is-more-expensive-than-ever">Tech talent is more expensive than ever.</h3>

<p>As anyone who has spent any time hiring engineers in the last decade knows: competition, always intense, is now fierce. If you haven’t spent any time hiring engineers, I’ll try to set the scene. The perks at a Google or a Facebook are legend, but perks are only a small fraction of the resources tech companies dedicate to hiring. Speaking with leaders at software companies, many will tell you their number one job is hiring. In fact hiring is one of the most important jobs a tech company has, often spending upwards of 20% of their employee’s working hours on nothing but hiring. This time spent includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dedicated sourcing and recruiting staff</li>
  <li>employees working interview loops</li>
  <li>campus and job fair visits</li>
  <li>hiring committees</li>
  <li>content marketing</li>
  <li>conferences</li>
  <li>and so much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>An entire industry has emerged helping candidates prepare for interviews, and another industry in evaluating candidates. Employees can make a serious side income of hundreds of thousands of dollars referring candidates to their firms. A $10k bonus for successfully referring a single candidate isn’t uncommon. Mind-blowing when you consider that average tenure for a tech employee in San Francisco before the pandemic was 18 months.</p>

<p>The competition justified by the potential for asymptotic returns, and the competition driven by structural changes like increased team sizes (as we touched on in <a href="https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/16/software-and-its-discontents-part-1.html#what-were-we-spending-the-cheap-money-on#what-were-we-spending-the-cheap-money-on">part 1, “what were we spending the cheap money on“</a>), and the simple inflationary pressures of too much money chasing too few potential employees have all, unsurprisingly, driven up salaries.</p>

<p>From 2010 to 2020 software salaries went up roughly 35% – prior to the pandemic and the current wave of inflation. Stock-based compensation practices also became more generous. Practices like annual refreshes, accelerated vesting, and widespread usage of RSUs all became more common in the last decade. As an engineering leader, a key new challenge in the last few years has been ensuring long-tenured employees aren’t unfairly under-compensated compared to new hires, a challenge that has driven change and innovation in equity approaches. The most dramatic percent raises in compensation have gone to early career folks and new grads, with interns regularly making 200% of the US median income. We’ve also started to see management and IC tracks diverge in compensation, heresy among the startups of the previous decade. These costs aren’t just rising in traditional high-cost locations like San Francisco and New York, but globally. Globally we’ve also see rapidly expanding domestic technology ecosystems competing for talent with companies looking to offshore out of high-cost locations, driving demand in markets where employers historically had the leverage. Average compensation in traditionally high talent density, low- and medium-cost locations like India, Poland, and Israel has more than doubled, and during the pandemic, when salaries shot up again, salaries for some specialties were inline with San Francisco. The number of companies shifting to remote-first or hybrid, which had been accelerating before the pandemic, exploded during the pandemic, driving increases in what had been, from a cost perspective, second- and third-tier talent markets. Some companies have gone as far as embracing one pay band globally. </p>

<p>Larger teams with rapidly rising median salaries and narrower compensation windows have put significant pressure on the “relatively low fixed cost” side of the equation.</p>

<h3 id="success-is-more-elusive">Success is more elusive.</h3>

<p>For the decade between 2000-2010, the most important trend to understand what was happening in tech was broadband adoption doubling annually. This was followed rapidly by an even more extreme curve for smartphone adoption. These trends created the opportunity to build thousands of new businesses largely without competition, and with a guaranteed pipeline of new customers. Building a successful technology business in this period was mostly about getting the damn code to run and being there waiting at the end of the conveyor belt as new customers were continuously minted. Those new customers made the theoretical returns to scale a reality, and made them seem like an inevitability. </p>

<p>Twenty years later, things have changed. Broadband and smartphone adoption have largely saturated. There are no new customers moving from snail mail to email, the video store to streaming, classifieds to web advertising, or the filing cabinet to online banking waiting to be snapped up. People have largely already adopted computers and the Internet to assist in their personal and work lives. A company starting today isn’t competing against an incumbent from an earlier technology regime, but a savvy technology native competitor. And the current generation of tech giant monopolists have consistently proven themselves extremely effective at avoiding being disrupted by upstarts. (The effectiveness of the current tech giants has also reinforced their technical and cultural practices without the blunting derision of being seen as “dinosaurs’’, a key contributor to <a href="https://laughingmeme.org/2023/01/23/software-and-its-discontents-part-2-complexity.html#aspirational-complexity">the aesthetic of complexity we talked about in part 2</a>, and a general cargo-culting across the industry)</p>

<p>That changing landscape has led the cheap money to search further afield for opportunities that can be tackled with software.  Companies have pushed into industries that share very little with the return to scale model at the heart of the Silicon Valley tech salary math. We now see businesses with significant physical costs, and high costs per customer like ride sharing, delivery or hardware businesses. We see businesses with high per-customer licensing costs, like the streaming music companies. We see pushes into logistically complex businesses, e.g. health care, where regulatory oversight raises the cost to scale significantly.</p>

<p>Our industry’s constant search for greener fields, jonesing for the same broadband/smartphone adoption high, also drives the goldfish-like optimism characteristic of our industry. The procession of “next big thing, this will change everything” includes: AI, Web3, NFTs, blockchain, chatbots, gig economy, AR, appstores, big data, smart assistants, peer-to-peer, 3D printers, <abbr title="internet of things">IoT</abbr>, <abbr title="social local mobile">SoLoMo</abbr>, feed driven virality, <abbr title="rich internet applications">RIAs</abbr>, virtual worlds, apps, applets, and portals. VR is probably the canonical example as it’s been the next big thing at least 4 times in my career, and I think I missed the first wave, having first shown up for VRML.  </p>

<p>Success is more difficult and elusive than ever. </p>

<p>Much smarter people than I am have pointed out that all this tends to be cyclical. “Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital” by <a href="https://carlotaperez.org/">Carlota Perez</a> is the canonical text on the topic if you wanted to dive into the deep end.</p>

<h3 id="lost-that-magic-feeling">Lost that magic feeling</h3>

<p>The 15 years following the rise of the web was a magical era for many looking to build new businesses. (Also magical for a whole bunch of other reasons that aren’t relevant to this article.) </p>

<p>You could lay out a relatively small amount of capital, hire a software engineering team, and build a wildly successful business that challenged existing industry titans in relatively short order. That expectation still forms the foundation for much of our industry. The decade of low interest rates and cheap money allowed us to put off critical reexamining those narratives. </p>

<p>Instead of re-examining those narratives, we spent. As complexity made software development harder, we hired larger teams, adding more complexity. As blockbuster businesses got harder to build, we spent even more on the talent needed to give us a shot at these increasingly elusive prize. As cost and complexity went up so did the precarity of the house of cards, and the difficulty of seeing a return. </p>

<p>In our current era it would be hard to point to a company more widely respected than Stripe. Now in its 14th year, it still isn’t profitable, still hasn’t gone public, and still primarily operates in a commodity market with well-established competitors.  Compare that to Amazon who IPOed after 3 years, Apple after 4 years, Yahoo after 2 years, Google after 6 years, Netflix after 5 years, and Facebook after 8 years, with Microsoft being the outlier at 11 years.  An IPO isn’t the definition of success, but it points to the new pressures the industry is experiencing, pressures that, among other things, have led to changing expectations in the workplace, and increased conflict between leadership and the workforce, even during a time of prosperity.  Which we’ll talk about in part 4.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kellan Elliott-McCrea</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is part 3 in my “Software and its Discontents” series.  This series is the product of speaking with a range of folks in the industry over several months about the sense that something about the current state of tech, startups and software has gone quite wrong.]]></summary></entry></feed>
